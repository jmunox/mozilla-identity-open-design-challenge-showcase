Core Mozilla programs and services will be aligned around protecting the health of the Internet, and our identity should reflect this purpose. </span><span>Mozilla is an activist brand, determined to change the world for the better, and our identity should reflect this spirit. </span></p><p class=\"c7 c9\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c7\"><span>Prior to this strategic alignment, Mozilla engaged the services of Pitch Interactive to develop a living logo to reflect the ever-changing nature of the Mozilla movement. As with all Mozilla projects, this logo development was conducted in the open; in early 2015, the Mozilla team decided to </span><span>suspend work on the log</span><span>o. Mozilla </span><span>brand positioning</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;and audience identification are now enabling a new brand expression to emerge. </span></p><p class=\"c7 c9\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">Meanwhile our Firefox product brand is undertaking a similar strategic exercise to focus on quality and innovation. </span></p><p class=\"c1 c9\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c1 c9\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c26\">Content Strategy &amp; Requirements</span><span class=\"c3\">:</span></p><h2 class=\"c12\" id=\"h.ocbn5uevmz8l\"><span class=\"c10 c35 c49\">Project Deliverables</span></h2><p class=\"c1 c9\"><span class=\"c36 c43 c46\"></span></p><a id=\"t.332abf2cdfe0854115a055e8b9233fd6d91daa51\"></a><a id=\"t.2\"></a><table class=\"c52\"><tbody><tr class=\"c2\"><td class=\"c18\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c20\"><span class=\"c36\">Item</span></p></td><td class=\"c13\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c20\"><span class=\"c11\">Content</span></p></td><td class=\"c4\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c20\"><span class=\"c11\">Goal</span></p></td><td class=\"c29\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c20\"><span class=\"c11\">Priority</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c2\"><td class=\"c18\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c0\"><span>Logo (symbol + </span><span>wordmark)</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;in printed and digital expression </span></p><p class=\"c0 c9\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c0 c9\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p></td><td class=\"c13\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3\">A distinctive visual representation of Mozilla&rsquo;s unique purpose in the world.

A brand identity – &nbsp;logo, tone, tagline, typeface &nbsp;– isn’t something to be trifled with, especially with a brand as well respected as Mozilla.</p><p>Here’s what’s happening.</p><p>Back in late 2014, the creative team began working on a new look for Mozilla, a so-called living logo. The graphic heartbeat of this logo came from real-time data about our engagement with the world. Having a brand identity that reflected the daily number of Bugzilla requests, Mozilla contributors, and Firefox users, for instance, was a brilliant idea. Except that, in the end, it couldn’t be made to work. Chalk that experience up to good learning.</p><p>Fast forward to today. As you heard Chris say onstage in Orlando, our mission and vision are now clearer and stronger than before. We’ve built&nbsp; a new brand position for Mozilla: <b>being a true personal advocate for online life. </b>We promise to advocate for people both within their online experience and on their behalf for the health of the Internet.</p><p>From that solid foundation, we’re ready to explore how our brand will look and sound in the world, reinforcing what we believe and what we can deliver. A 2016 goal for Mozilla is to Grow Our Influence in the world, and a new identity will make it easier.</p><p><b>Why are we doing this now?</b></p><p>Brands need to evolve to stay relevant. Introducing a refreshed identity will be a milestone for Mozilla, will provide a new badge of belonging to our movement, and will help tell the world what we stand for. When more people grok our mission, they will want to walk shoulder to shoulder with us and contribute more. Yes!</p><p>The need for a new Mozilla identity is also long overdue (see posts below). The &nbsp;word “Mozilla” and a handful of muted colors are no match for modern communication. Lacking an icon to represent our brand in social media, for instance, we have shown up as a heart, a whimsical unicorn, and even a famous candy. (Mozilla melts in your mouth, not in your hands?) Our whole organization, especially our Mozilla global communities, is eager for direction and a bigger toolkit of creative assets.</p><p>Like everything at Mozilla, this will be open source, including:</p><ul><li>An invitation to contribute. If you have an idea for what the Mozilla brand identity should look like, please write to me, send me a sketch or shoot a video. We’ll formalize design challenges through our <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/Community-Design\">Community Design github repo</a> as well.</li></ul><ul><li>A Brand Advisory Group. Made up of a cross-section of Mozillians, this group will bring different viewpoints and expertise to the table as we review our work in progress.</li></ul><ul><li>Access to working documents. Those who are interested and disclosed will be invited to view strategy, positioning, and briefing docs not available publicly.</li></ul><ul><li>An opportunity to geek out on branding stuff on the Engagement# Projects/<a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Engagement#Projects\">2016_Brand_Identity_Initiative</a> on the Mozilla wiki.</li></ul><p><b>What’s next?</b></p><p>We’re now selecting an agency partner for this work. Following a few rounds of creative review (highlights posted here), we hope to have a new Mozilla identity defined and ready to share later this year.</p><p>Oh, and we’re also starting to think about the Firefox identity. But that will have to wait for our next post.</p><p>Meanwhile, the comments box awaits your cursor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

A refreshed brand identity will provide a new badge of belonging to our movement, help us tell the world what we stand for, and attract the attention of people who might never have noticed Mozilla before. It will grow our impact in many ways and launching it will be a milestone. </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c4\"><span class=\"c1\">Currently Mozilla has only a word mark (the word &quot;Mozilla&quot; in the Fira Sans font) and three colors to represent our brand in the world. That&#39;s no way to build a Rebel Alliance. Modern communication over mobile devices and using social portals requires a much harder working set of tools. Our organization, especially our global Mozilla communities, is eager to get their hands on a greater range of creative assets.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c4\"><span class=\"c1\">Want to get involved in this effort?</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><ul class=\"c5 lst-kix_wd0a5adlna2k-0 start\"><li class=\"c4 c7\"><span>Let us know your thoughts by commenting on the Mozilla Identity project brief :</span><span><a class=\"c8\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/1p5fPGO&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1540482134026000\">&nbsp;</a></span><span class=\"c6\"><a class=\"c8\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/1p5fPGO&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1540482134026000\">http://bit.ly/1p5fPGO</a></span></li></ul><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><ul class=\"c5 lst-kix_wd0a5adlna2k-0\"><li class=\"c4 c7\"><span class=\"c1\">Show us what you think the Mozilla brand identity should look like.

It&rsquo;s more like remodeling, starting with a thorough assessment of the structure and its uses, now and in the future.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c4\"><span class=\"c1\">Redefining the purpose of the house may require work on the foundation, the reconfiguration of walls, the addition of rooms. (That work is underway at Mozilla today.) Only then does the cosmetic work begin. The skin of the house - the brand expression - should not only reflect what stands beneath but suggest the experience people will have once they enter.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c4\"><span class=\"c1\">An outdated brand expression won&rsquo;t attract many guests. A fresh one not only reinforces what the brand stands for but catches the_eye of passersby who might never have paid attention. Over time with a well-crafted brand identity and expression, a single image distills everything that brand represents. Picture the Nike swoosh.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c4\"><span>Our branded house needs to take into account our open source roots, our global footprint and appeal, and our desire to be one Mozilla. It should represent the spirit of our team and the products, technology, and people networks we stand up. We can do this! </span></p>",

We need to keep away from extreme minimalism, yet have subtle messages in our visual communications, spreading warmth and security to the viewers. There will be a middle point between skeuomorphism and flat design, where we need to find our balance. We should not be visually cheesy by faking textures on our mediums, rather than enhancing the feel of our material very subtly.</p><p>For Mozilla's symbol, it might be a wiser choice not to choose a mascot, considering we already have a Fox representing Firefox (and inevitably also us).</p><p>What I was thinking of are snowflakes. Every single snowflake has a unique arrangement of crystals, making every snowflake unique. I do not know how well that could work out visually, but conceptually, it aligns very well with our vision.</p><p>Will update the thread with more thoughts of mine</p>",

But I have a few knowledge about branding and with that confidence giving it a shot!<br>While I was thinking about what could be the possible icon of Mozilla, I asked one of my fellow designer (named Subinoy Mustofi Eron) how he think about it. Then he created a basic outline of two person shaking hand. Which was almost a heart shape. After exploring that basic shape with love, ended up with this. That hand shaking may not reflect boldness or guts but it surely does reflect bond/strength. The heart may represents wellness/love/community, there are more ways to interpret a heart shape used in a versatile community. I have further explored with various color tone and gradient.<br>Now for the part of being trendy or not trendy, it is a simple logo but the gradient can distinguish it from being called a flat logo.<br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7550283/14042989/98904892-f2a9-11e5-97d2-cada1bd1b9d8.png\"><img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7550283/14042989/98904892-f2a9-11e5-97d2-cada1bd1b9d8.png\" alt=\"mozilla-rebranding-pitch\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p><p>I also like elio's approach of pattern and watercolor background.

The soft curves of the symbol you developed have a warmth and welcome that speak to the community aspect of Mozilla's brand. It's an invitation to participate. There does seem to be a similarity to the shape and feel of the Airbnb \"belo\" logo. It also makes me wonder if our symbol needs to reflect somehow the work that we do.

Your point about changes in view ports driving design decisions is particularly insightful. I learned a lot. Thanks for sharing this.</p><p>A word of caution regarding exploring the pigeon as a symbol, as it evokes different feelings in different cultures. In urban areas in the U.S. for instance, the pigeon is seen as a symbol of blight and uncleanliness, for instance, rather than a mark of freedom. The dove is usually seen as a representation of peace (and sometimes freedom), so that might be a better aviary symbol if we were to go down that path.</p><p>I am not sure that animals, even though they have been a important part of our past design language, are going to be right for us going forward except as new products alongside Firefox. My hunch is that the symbol for Mozilla will not be animal based since that may not contribute to an understanding of what we do and believe in (although I could be wrong about this).

Do we take action and provoke a reaction like Greenpeace? Or are we here to educate and advocate, leaving the action to others?

Now that’s not much of a shock – brand consultancy talks to potential client about new project? There’s nothing new to see here, ladies and gentlemen, move along.</p><p>But, before you do, consider this – have you ever seen a big re-brand carried out in public – right out in the open? With all of its processes, stages, wrong turns, reboots and results out there for everyone to applaud, critique or chastise?</p><p>I’m betting the answer is no.</p><p>Because branding and brand identity is a process best carried out behind closed doors – within, not without. With tightly controlled parameters, a carefully curated project team and a hand-selected brand consultant in tow. Yes?</p><p>Well, yes. . . usually.</p><p>The steps normally start with research, followed by ‘narrative’ work that concentrates on an organization’s verbal brand, before moving on to its visual brand and all that it entails.</p><p>Sometimes it’s a beautiful, breezy process that skips along in a matter of weeks. Often it’s bruising and political. It can demand as much diplomacy as design, and a rhino-like hide to deal with the knock-backs. (Just last week we finally had a route signed off by a global NGO twenty-six months after we wrote our first proposal).</p><p>Now, imagine that you were to do all of that, but do it in the open. Imagine that you were to pry open branding’s ‘black box’, replace its opaque walls with glass or even remove them altogether. Imagine a process where each stage is published, in the open, and all can comment, freely.</p><p>That’s exactly what we’re about to do.<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-21 alignleft\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/06/dmb_logo_orange-300x154.jpg\" alt=\"dmb_logo_orange\" width=\"300\" height=\"154\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/dmb_logo_orange-300x154.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/dmb_logo_orange-600x308.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/dmb_logo_orange-1000x513.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></p><p>It’s fair to say that there’s very little precedent for this. Normally re-brands arrive, fully formed, like the Aol re-jig a few years back. Some, like the Airbnb project, ride a wave of controversy for a while (remember the ‘does-my-symbol-look-like-your-genitals’ <a href=\"http://blog.airbnb.com/belo-report-new-airbnb-symbol-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\">story</a>?) but the furor usually dies down pretty quick.</p><p><img class=\"wp-image-22 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/06/jb_arkitypo_2000_150-220x300.jpg\" alt=\"jb_arkitypo_2000_150\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\"></p><p>Genuine precedent for someone re-branding in the open is hard to find. Continuum did publish several stages of its design work on Design Museum Boston’s new brand on the <a href=\"http://www.core77.com/posts/17027/open-for-branding-continuums-transparent-design-project-for-design-museum-boston-17027\" target=\"_blank\">Core77 blog</a> back in 2011.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here in London, we’ve shared the design stages of projects such as this one for <a href=\"http://johnsonbanks.co.uk/exhibitions-and-3d/glenfiddich-barrel-art/\" target=\"_blank\">Glenfiddich</a>, or our work on an experimental 3-D typeface with <a href=\"http://johnsonbanks.co.uk/thoughtfortheweek/arkitypo-the-final-alphabet/\" target=\"_blank\">Ravensbourne</a>.

Now that understanding of what branding can do has seeped upwards from the marketing department to the boardroom, Chief Executives, Chairs and their boards are much more involved. They want to be integrated into the process – not just presented with a “fait accompli”.</p><p>But add greater corporate involvement to wider public awareness of branding and that equals increased risk. Consider the pummeling that brand changes can now receive online – the outcry over</p><p>Gap’s proposed <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/dont_mind_the_gap_or_the_square.php#.V1p-gFMrK3A\" target=\"_blank\">change</a> to its blue square , or those seemingly inevitable ‘my four-year-old daughter could have done that’ comments? Just the simplest of changes to a symbol can cause an uproar, even if the proposed amendments are minor. Opt for full-on revolution and most of hell can open up and consume all concerned (well, OK not quite, but believe me it feels pretty bad when a re-brand gets mauled).</p><p>Knowing all of this, with all the known hurdles ahead of us (and imagining the ones we don’t yet know, to paraphrase Mr Rumsfeld), why consider re-branding in the open?</p><p>Well, for starters, Mozilla is a pioneer of open-source, the new normal for coding that we all now take for granted. One coder stands on the shoulders of another and we all get better software as a result. If it makes sense to code collaboratively, in the open, why not design in the open too?</p><p>Second, in an age of ‘agile’ and ‘lean’ management, why wait for six months to listen to feedback – why not try shorter design ‘sprints’, then share and test as we go along?</p><p>Third, this is an organization with over a thousand employees and a vast global community of volunteers who know Mozilla far better than us. It is far more reciprocal to involve and to listen, rather than to command and to tell once a decision has been made.</p><p>This project could make us all think afresh about the branding business. It will certainly open the_eyes of thousands to how a robust design process is carried out. And perhaps, just perhaps, it will make millions see that ‘branding’ is about much, much more than just a logo.</p><p><em>Michael Johnson:</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Strategy and Creative Director of j<a href=\"http://johnsonbanks.co.uk/\">ohnson banks</a>, a brand consultancy based in London with clients across the globe</em></p>",

It involved locking myself and a small team in a room for a long time and unveiling the results at the end in a big “ta-da.” Now, I’m about to kick off an open design process for the Mozilla brand identity, and it’s going to turn everything on its head.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Old Way: Controlled and Consistent </b></p><p>As creative director at retail giant Target, I was lucky to work with agencies and internal teams that developed dozens of brands, some of them now worth billions. In hindsight, our process was pretty straightforward. The merchants identified the market opportunity, marketing did research and gathered insights to come up with brand positioning, and our creative team led design.</p><p>The design phase lasted for months and included qualitative and quantitative testing to reach a data-driven consensus. After that, we had a tidy solution ready to stamp on packaging and signage and launch with a TV and print campaign. The stone tablets came down from the mountain, and we enforced the law of the brand.</p><p>Only a tiny percentage of our end users had a say in how the brand would look. We treated these customer focus groups and eye-tracking tests like a necessary nuisance to validate what our superior experience and intuition dictated as the right design for the brand. We were the experts. Engagement with the rest of our users consisted of them putting the freshly branded product into their shopping basket (or not) and, with our prodding, telling their friends about their purchase at spin class and on Facebook.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div id=\"attachment_61\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-61 size-medium\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/06/4931937747_aa4c850fec_b-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/4931937747_aa4c850fec_b-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/4931937747_aa4c850fec_b-600x399.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/4931937747_aa4c850fec_b-1000x665.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/4931937747_aa4c850fec_b.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><b>Train wheel in Wakkanai, Motohiro Sunoichi</b></p></div><p><b>Setting off to an Unknown Destination </b></p><p>Now, I am a stranger in a strange land. I work for Mozilla, the nonprofit that’s fighting for an equal Internet for everyone and the parent brand for the open-source Firefox browser. Over 30,000 volunteers contribute to our cause by writing code, translating web pages, and building community with other open-source advocates in cities and villages around the world. We offer a radical invitation to participate, and we show our work, even when it’s incomplete or messy.</p><p>I’m responsible for leading the development of a new brand identity for Mozilla. Today our style guide consists of a wordmark and a handful of muted colors—creative assets not up to the challenge of modern social communication. Mozilla keeps getting tangled up with Firefox, its main product. With the absence of a brand system, our communities and teams have spun up their own logos to celebrate their existence on T-shirts, stickers, and websites. And our wordmark doesn’t do justice to our fight for a free and open internet.</p><p>This is just the sort of chaos I would have loved to untangle at Target. With the help of a big creative agency partner, the brand outcome could almost be predetermined at the outset: a design solution that could be imposed on the masses, applied and policed with care. At Mozilla though, our independent maker mindset ignores hierarchical dictats in a constant search for the new. A top-down brand might well be ignored or rejected by the community we champion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>A Few Lines in the Sand</b></p><p>As we interviewed some of the world’s best brand identity agencies for this assignment, it became clear that we would have to do this work in an unconventional way. As Mozilla we have permission—and an obligation—to work in the open and engage as many citizen-designers around the world who want to contribute. Our agency pick, London-based johnson banks, was equally enthusiastic about trying something new.</p><p>It dawned on us: the process will become the project. We’ll let go of a controlled outcome and have faith that what emerges will work. (<i>Let go</i>. Simply writing those words scares the bejeezus out of me.)</p><p>A few rules for our sandbox:</p><ul><li><b>We won’t default to a crowd-sourced solution.</b> Engagement will come in the idea generation phase, the critique of the work, and in how it gets used by Mozillians.</li><li><b>We will still guide and curate the work as transparently as possible</b>, just as we do with Firefox and the other open-source projects at Mozilla.</li><li><b>We’ll keep the wheels on the bus.</b> We’ll have a timeline with milestones and an end date.</li><li><b>We’ll aim for a flexible brand system</b> recognizable as Mozilla so that we can gain the awareness that comes from repeated exposure.</li><li><b>We won’t vote on the outcome.</b> The clicks of the crowd won’t drumpf all.</li></ul><p>What might this process look like? We’re already asking talented folks in our Mozilla community design group to generate ideas. We’re publishing our process on this blog and our Medium channel, where we’ll welcome feedback. We will record or live-stream some working sessions and find or host live events where other designers can critique the work.</p><p>The journey is beginning, and you’re invited to come.

The downside is that ‘good’ is so general that it’s hard to really pinpoint a specific area of “goodness” to go with. I think after reading the For Good and Change Makers themes it gave a sort of.. hope, I guess? Wanting to back Mozilla in the hope that the internet will be better with Mozilla on our side. Those themes also gave a “humanity first” type vibe (sort of like with Canonical’s Ubuntu).</p> <p>The Guide and For All didn’t really do much for me either way. They were okay, but they didn’t particularly “grab” me.</p> <p>The Fight, For Freedom, and to a lesser extent The Protector actually gave off some slight dystopian vibes. It’s quite difficult to convey freedom and protection on those themes without Orwellian/prison state imagery, and I definitely don’t associate those with Mozilla. This also ties into the Change Makers/For Good themes, as they seem to push the concept of everyone working together to fight/protect/free the internet, rather than one entity who we should trust to do all the work for us.</p>",

I believe that’s the only way to engage people who would otherwise not care. (Themes around “for good”, “love”, etc are feel-good themes that won’t truly engage those who aren’t already deeply involved in the subject.) Normal human beings need to see why we’re fighting for the open web, and it needs to be explained in a way that makes sense. Then, Mozilla should be seen as a force of good in that fight. </p> <p>There’s a balance here between acting as a police against the “bad” and demonstrating though leadership and forward movement towards the “good”.

This one is more like “glass half full” rather than “half empty”.</p> <p>Although no individuals or personalities were included in this to reinforce the brand, it’s easy to associate “For Good” to people like Ghandi, Martin Luther King and Barrack Obama. These are people that wanted change but usually spoke about it in a positive manner (or at least that how I remember them). Their most famous quotes talk more about their dreams of good bright futures than focusing on the bad of today.</p> <p>“You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.” -MG<br> “The future rewards those who press on. I don’t have time to feel sorry for myself. I don’t have time to complain. I’m going to press on.” -BO<br> “Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.” -BO<br> “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” -MLK<br> “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?'” -MLK<br> “I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.” -MLK</p> <p>The only thing I don’t completely agree with in this positioning is… “The profit motive is destroying the Internet. So take away the profit motive.” This isn’t a positive twist like the rest of the positioning. We also can’t forget that profit helped build the web. I think a more positive tone can be used to address this point. For example, “freedom over profit” or “Free web for all, not just for some” or “A free web profits everyone”.</p> <p>Great job on these 7 incredible brand and positioning ideas.

The Internet not only follows on the heels of other basic needs but is increasingly critical to the delivery of basic needs to populations in need.

I’ll admit, I’ve never been comfortable with any major branding or promotional campaigns that make our open source/non-profitness a key point. Even though it is, in fact, an important part of what Mozilla is, going on too much about how we’re open and free and non-profit and fighting for the little guy and defending liberty and justice for all can tread into the realm of sounding, well, hippy-dippy. This stuff is important, but there’s only so much you can talk about it before you start picturing hippies smoking weed and putting flowers in their hair while dancing barefoot in the park. :)</p> <p>Our brand needs to be something that says who we are without shoving messages down the throat of the audience. This is a common theme among my comments on these themes: a worry about being too powerful in messaging, in a way that overwhelms what we are when trying to say who we are, and overstates why we are in way that could be offputting to some people.</p>",

Let’s make good things happen together.</p> <p>You also need to be cautious about selecting political figures and organizations—in particular, recent ones—as representations of a brand identity. I saw various combinations of people and groups above who would not be positive symbols for a number of people I know.</p> <p>What I’m noticing is that most of these themes have bits and pieces I like but in general I’m not a huge fan of any of them. It’s interesting.</p> <p>Also, while “Doers, not dreamers” sounds good, all I can think is “you say ‘doers, not dreamers'” but surround this phrase with imagery and statements all about dreaming of change.

The security guard that keeps bad guys and viruses out of your system. The sherpa showing you how to safely ascend to the pinnacle of success and helping you get there with everything you need to have with you to achieve your goals.</p> <p>I’ve often thought of Firefox as my sherpa in that way; wise and helpful, with great skill and knowledge of the Web.

Love and rainbows and such; it’s a little over the top.</p> <p>But we need to keep in mind, as I’ve alluded to on other themes, that not everyone is an activist. Not everyone cares about the same ideals. So we need to be careful about what we choose to make a big deal of.</p> <p>I do want to caution again about being very careful with what people and groups you choose to reflect your ideals. For example, I’ve seen imagery of President Obama in a few places on these themes, representing hope and change and such. But not everyone sees him that way; to other people he’s more a symbol of wishy-washy, ineffective leadership.</p> <p>Similarly, Ronald Reagan might be seen as an example of strength and leadership by some while to others he might represent carelessness and wastefulness. Different people will react different ways to these images, and given how polarizing politics can be, there’s far too much risk of annoying a disproportionately large percentage of possible users.

While we don’t want deliberately to shut out people who share our values, we also don’t want to be so blandly amenable that we recede into the background. (Some have argued that we are not as relevant as we once were; I disagree but think we need to tell our story more strongly.) A strong brand will not appeal to everyone and that’s OK. We believe there is an enormous pool of people globally who want a freer, less commercial, more independent Internet experience if they have been online for a while, and others who just want to access a fair and equal Internet at all. People who take considered steps in their offline life (like voting, volunteering, and making environmental choices for instance) but have yet to apply those same values to their life online. Once they know Mozilla, they will want to become a part of our community and mission. Thanks for sparking this dialogue.</p>",

Will this quixotic quest land or flame out?</p><p>So far, so good. We held an open house at a Mozilla all-hands meeting last week, and 150 Mozillians showed up to offer passionate (and contradictory) feedback. We shared some background on why brand matters and put up seven possible themes we could follow to craft initial concepts.</p><p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xb8diasam0w\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p>Next, we spun up this blog and a <a href=\"https://medium.com/mozilla-branding\">Medium channel</a> to engage designers. The story got picked up by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3060836/uh-oh-mozilla-is-open-sourcing-the-design-of-its-new-logo&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1466798218231000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHo8PqNEUjS6XylKHi2Cdbbvqd55w\">FastCo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/21/mozilla-open-design/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1466798587644000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEGZxGG5Ze5suVKjPoXhxI8TTq_Jw\">Engadget</a>, who covered it fairly. We’re getting a steady flow of comments from folks interested in vetting the seven themes, contributing their ideas, or critiquing this never-been-tried process. A few have mistaken what we’re up to (more on that below), but it’s net positive.</p><p><b>What we’ve learned.</b></p><p>Overall, Mozillians are hungry for a strong, distinct brand. They want us to be better known and understood—and recognize how a brand refresh can help. Their feedback pointed to two minor refinements and a pretty sizeable one.</p><p>One minor miss was the insufficient reference to “Open” as a belief system. Mozilla talks about the Internet being more open, meaning that everyone can participate easily and safely without having to sacrifice their data identity or their freedom to roam. We stand for transparency not only in how we conduct our operations but in other realms—from open government to open patents. It’s a thing with us, and we didn’t do it justice.</p><p>The other small miss was our suggestion that Mozilla “does” stuff on its own. What we really care about is enabling people to take action. Like understand their value online. Encrypt their own web properties. Choose to go to the source for news instead of view it within a closed social media platform that’s selling their clicks without consent.</p><p>If we were to start fresh, we’d make “Open” more obvious and make it clear that Mozilla empowers people by giving them the know-how to take action on their own behalf.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-102 size-medium\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/06/download-copy-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"download copy\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/download-copy-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/download-copy-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/download-copy-600x600.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/download-copy-1000x1000.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/download-copy-32x32.jpg 32w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/download-copy-50x50.jpg 50w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/download-copy-64x64.jpg 64w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/download-copy-96x96.jpg 96w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/download-copy-128x128.jpg 128w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/06/download-copy-45x45.jpg 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">Now for the dope-slap. </b></p><p>We spread the work out in front of one of our senior leaders, who stared at the posters for many long and increasingly uncomfortable minutes before clearing her throat. “You missed optimism,” she said flatly. “Look, the Internet is one of humankind’s greatest inventions and it’s not over. Where’s the joy? This is really exciting and everything I see here sounds like we’re moping and playing defense.”</p><p>Preach it. Another colleague chimed in that the Internet is more amazing now than ever, growing faster, and driving greater change in the world. We can choose to focus on what’s broken or on what’s awesome.</p><p>They were right, it was a big miss. The seven thematic pathways were built from the brand personality we’d shaped for Mozilla, including these key attributes: Gutsy, Independent, Open-minded, For Good. We were so focused on making sure people realized the threats from increasing corporate control that we left off the optimism and positive energy Mozilla represents.</p><p>So we’re taking the feedback into consideration and will likely revise our brand personality in the days ahead. It’s unlikely we’ll create an 8th theme focused solely on this idea of optimism about the Internet. Rather we’ll bake it into our next round of work.</p><p>No single theme is meant to be the answer. All are jumping off points for further creative exploration. So don’t look for Mozilla’s logo to be a big thumbs up. Do look for our brand to bring some kick-ass confidence and surprise to the fore in our initial three or so concepts. That’s the next phase of our work once we’ve gathered more feedback from designers in the wild (nudge).</p><p>Now, back to the confusion around what we’re up to. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/21/mozilla-open-design/\">Engadget’s</a> “Browsy McBrowserface” headline, referencing a famous <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/world/europe/boaty-mcboatface-what-you-get-when-you-let-the-internet-decide.html?_r%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1466798218225000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHG3hii4z9oqnAHOhnEkzqYHgt9dQ\">wisdom-of-the-crowd fail</a>, implied we would let the Internet vote. They also conflated Mozilla and Firefox (Mozilla isn’t a browser), making us doubly glad to be engaged in this brand work.</p><p>Here’s what we’re doing. We’re asking for ideas and feedback while pulling back the curtain on how brand identity is done. We’re listening, panning for gold in the comments. We’re not crowd-sourcing. No voting, hijacked or otherwise, will take place. We’re open-minded, not naive.</p><p>So come join us. This Creative Strategy phase will be open until June 30.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The advanced users stop talking about Firefox to their friends and family. Their friends and family install Chrome from the link on Google’s homepage, or even go back to IE/Edge, particularly the next time they buy a new computer. User share drops to 10-15%.

There will be 5 masterclasses, mostly on alternating weeks, they will be scheduled &amp; recorded in PDT. We are locking down the schedule now. Summer Pilot will end week of Sept 5. Labs sessions will be scheduled in alternative weeks, scheduling and invites will be responsibility of the Labs facilitators. In some cases we will use alternatives to Vidyo, like Hangouts, or maybe even physical spaces.</li>  <li>Will TechSpeakers be focused on technical topic presentations?</li>  <li>Yes, primarily. This is a Developer Relations initiative to extend our influence and our message to technical communities worldwide. But if you are already talking to web designers and other web builders or technical advocates, you are also eligible to apply. If the audience you work with now is children, web beginners, consumers who are not technical, this is probably not the program for you.</li>  <li>Could the program material be available to others Mozillians, who will not be in program?</li>  <li>Yes, all the Masterclasses will be available publicly over Airmo, probably a week or two after they are first broadcast for the Pilot team. The methodology for doing Speaking practice with constructive feedback as a small group either in person or online is available for anyone to use and organize in your school, community, hackerspace, or office.  There’s some info here: <a href=\"https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/next-steps-mozilla-tech-speakers-developer-events/6837\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/next-steps-mozilla-tech-speakers-developer-events/6837</a> and on the wiki.</li>  <li>Any similarities to larger community speaking projects, like Toastmasters?</li>  <li>Well, yes and no. Our focus is on speaking, teaching, facilitating for developer, designer, web builder audiences. Toastmasters is a great resource for anyone who wants to do more public speaking - we are more focused on getting a message out that solves a problem for a technical person, and encourages them to work with Firefox, Mozilla, &amp; the Open Web. In Toastmasters, there is more emphasis on the craft of public speaking (reducing “ums” in your presentation)</li>  <li>Only Mozilla technologies, right?</li>  <li>Firefox, Mozilla, &amp; the Open Web (w/a technical focus). So, for instance speaking about what’s new in JavaScript, CSS, Rust are all great topics, not exclusively Mozilla. ) Also, “How to get started in Open Source by logging bugs to bugzilla” might be a powerful topic to present in your community. There is no “one size fits all”</li>  <li>  <a href=\"http://meetup.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">meetup.com</a> is a very interesting platform (not a question, just a shout-out!) Yes!</li>  <li>We are happy to support people who are designing meetups on technical topics of interest to Mozilla, Firefox and the Web, or just want to organize a meetup about Tech Speaking (ex: <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Tech-Speakers-London/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.meetup.com/Tech-Speakers-London/</a>)</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>TOPIC 3 - About Mozilla Open Design</strong> - Tim Murray and Janis Greenspan</p>  <ul>  <li>We’re updating our brand identity using Mozilla open source principles, and we’d really like your thoughts.

It is about creating something good together and sharing it with everyone to change for the better. I would consider this as the most central principle of Mozilla. This theme probably fits the best to my idea of what Mozilla stands for: </p> <p>“Free to realize together a better web for all”</p>",

Love your emphasis on “together.” Many people who use the Internet are unaware of the trade-offs they are making for the content they desire. To them, the Web doesn’t need to get better; it works just fine as it is. How important is it for Mozilla to educate those people about what’s good and bad about today’s Internet first, before we can ask them to be a part of the “together” we envision?</p>",

Occupy London, peaceful sit ins, Tienanmen Square, unarmed students massacred by the PLA, The Hong Kong Umbrella Revolution if I’m not mistaken, non violent street protests. </p> <p>The very fact that we perceive any form of protest as angry, pushy, aggressive and attribute negative connotations to the word activist is exactly why people are not doing anything about their shrinking online liberties. Make no mistake, we are in a struggle. An open internet is in direct opposition to the goals of almost every government world wide. Simply by raising awareness of how to avoid online tracking, before you look at anything else, Mozilla makes itself diametrically opposed to the claimed “national interest” of every nation conducting online surveillance. Same with its support of un-backdoored encryption. Same with its financial support for technologies like Tor and Tails.</p> <p>This is a fight. This has always been a fight. But as the images above show, there are many ways to fight and if we challenge our preconceived notions and think about these images critically we will see that fighting isn’t always “angry and pushy”. The fight can be a provocative yet nuanced theme that truly and honestly reflects the realities of the world, that powerful entities control the internet and they do not have our best interests at heart. They need to be stood up to.</p> <p>I vote for the fight.</p>",

The process of getting there has begun in English; I wish we had the resources at hand to publish simultaneously in major languages at least. </p> <p>Our localization team is made up mostly of volunteer contributors who translate and localize a great deal of Mozilla and Firefox communication.

Were we to move forward with Freedom as a direction, for instance, our visual language would have to steer clear of any suggestion that we’re representing a single point of view. Setting our sites on the future growth of the Internet as a means of expression and independence for all would be a way to embrace the concept of freedom without the baggage that many now associate with that word.

Whether the larger power is governmental or corporate, individuals who are well informed and motivated to seek independence will ultimately prevail as history proves. Our biggest challenge with The Fight is its perpetuity. Can we sustain it? We see a future where the increasing corporate and government control of the Internet begins to reverse through the distributed actions of good people who make positive choices for themselves and others. We can help bring that about by empowering people to inform themselves and act on their conscience. The Fight we may need to wage is to shake people out of their feelings of complacency (and complicity) and paint a vision of an alternate future for them to seek.

Internet.org, the Facebook initiative to provide baseline access to only a limited range of Website services in India, may have temporarily subverted the language of “for all,” but we still believe in that principle. To your point, many people coming online for the first time do so with a smartphone. Asked if they are on the Internet, they often reply, “Yes, I’m on Facebook.” or “I use WhatsApp.” They are unaware that a universe of knowledge, connection, and opportunity exists outside of a handful of apps, and they have no idea that they personally are empowered to grow the future Internet. Our role is to educate and demonstrate that options exist to corporate consolidation. It should not become a new form of digital divide.</p>",

For example, displaying a promotion to savetheinternet.eu (which is highly needed since net neutrality is at stake in Europe). Another example in the U.S. would be comments on FCC.<br> Other parts of the world (South America, Asia, Africa) are covered by the community (why?). </p> <p>“Too much privilege for the few” is a topic Mozilla should deal with internally first before rebranding. Mitchell is inviting thoughts on her blog.<br> My last bad experience were with the renaming of Mozilla Community Design (on GitHub) to Open Design – out of a sudden. Elio could tell me that they got consent on MozLondon. But from the point of view of a contributor it wasn’t clear that the name would change. We have to work on that. An announcement being the absolute minimum.</p> <p>I consider Open Design as a step in the right direction for gathering the ideas of many.</p>",

I agree that trust would need to be a core underpinning of a Mozilla identity built around being an Internet guide but we might not choose to project it to the world. As a trait of brand character, trust is difficult to claim. Trust is proven through consistent action to the point that an audience has a good ability to predict how one will act. The louder a brand or a person professes to be trustworthy, paradoxically the more its motives are called into question. Is Mozilla trustworthy? Like everyone else, we would love to think so. The actions we’ve taken to nurture, celebrate, and protect the Internet are well documented. Candidly some have found that evolution in our core product or some particular judgment call we’ve made over the years has failed to match their initial perception of us, and we will have to earn back the trust of those people (or agree to disagree). We will continue to act in the best interest of the Internet and the individuals who use it and by doing so hope to sustain the trust that’s grown around us. That’s the best a Guide can do.</p>",

      "content": "<p>After the fusillade of recent posts and articles on this open design project, it&nbsp; occurred to me that we hadn’t really shared in detail the issues that Mozilla face. So this piece digs a little deeper into the obstacles and opportunities facing the organization.</p><p>Like many, we weren’t completely clear who Mozilla were when they contacted us earlier in the year. Yes, we knew the name and of course we know and use Firefox, but how the two were interrelated wasn’t clear. And the fact that Mozilla is a non-profit? Completely passed us by.</p><p>After a brief bit of research, especially within the tech community, we realized that Mozilla was seen by some as a hero of the Internet. They had stood up to ‘Internet Explorer’ (in the days when Microsoft controlled most of the world’s browsing) and were one of the pioneers of ‘open source’. They are a non-profit in an Internet world that is increasingly closed, tracked and monetized.</p><p>This is a great back story, and helps explains the residual goodwill that we encounter in virtually every conversation we have. Yet, somewhere along the way, Mozilla’s ‘reason to be’ got a little lost. If your answer to the question ‘why are you here?’ is ‘to keep updating Firefox’, well that’s not much of a response. Especially when Firefox is caught in a browser war with the very powerful and extremely well funded Chrome.</p><p>But, there’s no doubt that to the tech community, affection remains – and they would ‘come back’, if encouraged to do so.</p><p>Currently, the majority of the world’s population couldn’t give two hoots about who is watching their searches, why those ads keep following them and what a walled garden means, let alone who waters it. But, just as hundreds of thousands choose to read The Guardian on paper and millions in pixels, there’s clearly a segment of the world that does care how they use the Internet, and how the Internet uses them. In simple terms – there’s an audience out there who cares about this stuff, and in a world slowly waking up to online issues, it’s a growing one.</p><p>So it’s no great surprise that Mozilla’s team has been looking hard at how they want to verbally define the organization going forward, which led to the seven themes we shared a week ago (and the tweaks we’ve already started to make).</p><p><img class=\"wp-image-111 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_themes_overview-1024x677.png\" alt=\"Mozilla_themes_overview\" width=\"1024\" height=\"677\">If that’s the work in progress on the ‘verbal’ definition of Mozilla, what about the visual? Well, from a naming perspective, ‘Mozilla’ is great – it’s short, memorable and, typographically tasty (what with that ‘z’ and all).</p><p><img class=\"wp-image-113 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_logo-300x116.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla_Audit_logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"116\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_logo-300x116.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_logo-600x232.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_logo-1000x387.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_logo.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">What many don’t realize is that the name was a combination of ‘Mosaic killer’ and ‘Godzilla’ (Mosaic being one of the earliest non-open source browsers). For many years its identity was led by a dinosaur, drawn by Shepard Fairey, way before his Obama/Hope fame, and it’s little surprise that Mozilla communities across the world adopted or created variants on the dinosaur/lizard theme with gusto.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-114\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_dino_etc-1024x297.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla_Audit_dino_etc\" width=\"1024\" height=\"297\">A few years ago, a decision was taken to retire the dinosaur, replaced by a fairly corporate looking design system. Slowly things started to look more neutral and less edgy – which is odd for an organization with some pretty hard hitting things to say.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-115 size-large\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_online-1024x638.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla_Audit_online\" width=\"1024\" height=\"638\">It had staked most of its visual estate on a grey piece of lower-case type, written in Meta – once described as the ‘Helvetica of the 90s’ – and the feisty edge of Mozilla’s communications and messaging began to lose their punch.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-116\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_other_meta-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla_Audit_other_meta\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_other_meta-300x199.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_other_meta-600x398.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_other_meta-1000x663.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_other_meta.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">Now, 18 years ago Meta was truly the meta-typeface, and I too used it on everything, just like the rest of the world. But that’s part of the problem – if everyone from Mumsnet to furniture manufacturers and children’s charities use the same typography, you’re not going to stand out.<br>And the lack of an official symbol of any kind is also a handicap. Many digital brands now combine word marks (think of the Twitter and Instagram) with symbols that encapsulate their brands down into tiny icons (Twitter’s bird and Instagram’s camera). These are identity systems that can cope with any environment and every need, writ large on a billboard or battling it out at 48 pixels. The closest Mozilla has come is a red heart (but that might be a little tricky to trademark) and the occasional use of the lowercase ‘m’ from the word mark.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-117 size-large\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_architecture-1024x711.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla_Audit_architecture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"711\">Couple typographic neutrality and the vacuum created by the lack of a symbol with the happy chaos that is the organization’s brand architecture…</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-118 size-large\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_subbrands-1024x842.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla_Audit_subbrands\" width=\"1024\" height=\"842\">…its sub-brands…</p><p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-119 alignnone\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_colours-300x243.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla_Audit_colours\" width=\"300\" height=\"243\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_colours-300x243.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_colours-600x486.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_colours-1000x809.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_colours.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-120 alignnone\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_grads_tabs-300x188.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla_Audit_grads_tabs\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_grads_tabs-300x188.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_grads_tabs-600x376.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_grads_tabs-1000x627.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_grads_tabs.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></p><p>…and a gradient rich house style which is looking a little behind the times.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-121\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/07/Mozilla_Audit_communities-1024x703.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla_Audit_communities\" width=\"1024\" height=\"703\">Without any clear branding system and the lack of direction from HQ, community identities began to switch back and forth between dinosaurs, lizards, foxes and, er, elephants.

      "content": "<p>Thanks, Leonard. We want to help users know their worth and individual power on the Internet without over-emphasizing the threats to this independence. Experiencing the freedom, knowledge, and opportunity that comes with being online is something to be celebrated, not feared. Corporations have long used positive language in their advertising to attract customers and, at times, conceal ulterior motivations. They do this because it works. If only big internet companies are allowed to use the language of optimism and potential, while those of us demonstrating an alternate path are left shaking their metaphorical fists and warning that the sky is falling, people will choose accordingly. We have a lot to celebrate about the future of the Internet legitimately, and believe that independence from corporate centralization is the best way to experience that future. It’s both. </p> <p>The Firefox browser continues to improve in performance and stability with more improvements on the way this year. People who use Firefox will increasingly get a great experience while also supporting the work of Mozilla to bring web literacy, equal access, and greater privacy and security to the Internet. No sacrifice needed! </p> <p>Thanks again for contributing to this conversation.</p>",

You clearly have a great understanding of brand strategy and positioning. </p> <p>We agree that the ecosystems created by Google, Apple, Microsoft, and others are very enticing and can add a lot of value to individual users. Trying to convince people otherwise would be foolhardy. While each of these companies produces a browser product (Chrome, Safari, IE and Edge respectively) that competes with Firefox, that should not suggest that Mozilla is in the same competitive set as their parent companies. We are not in the business of creating closed systems designed to capture and hold users, nor is our business model dependent on providing access to the data of those users. As a nonprofit, open-source, collaborative organization we measure our worth differently, so direct comparisons to technology companies would not be accurate. We’ll never have their budgets. </p> <p>What we do have is a current audience of followers that is incredibly passionate and committed, and we’ve identified a much larger audience of people who live by their values offline, but have yet to apply those same values to their online lives. Once we reach those people and help them realize that they have a choice between complacency vs. empowerment, passive acceptance vs. active participation in the Internet, we know that we will grow. We have already proven that by being fearless advocates and showing the way through products like Firefox, we can influence big corporate players and expand the power of the Internet as a force of good.</p>",

Whilst I agree that they form part of the Mozilla manifesto and that we should take an interest in them, I always feel a bit concerned when there is focus on privacy and the “surveillance state”, as these views can make us look a bit of a anti-government fringe outfit, which could alienate us.</p> <p>Yes, we would have to be careful with this brand (just look at Google with its “do no evil” approach!), but I think that this option sums up for me what Mozilla (and open source more generally) is all about.</p> <p>Whilst I fully appreciate that this process to build a new brand identity is a collaborative process of many parts, I appreciate the opportunity to contribute and am grateful of how it has crystallized my opinion of what we do at Mozilla.

Our global research confirms that a large pool of people make choices in their offline life (like voting, volunteering, recycling, caring for the environment, etc.) that promote the good of their society. Many of these people are unaware that they can activate similar values in their decisions about online life. Once this group learns that Mozilla puts people ahead of profit and puts its resources to work improving the health, accessibility, and knowledge of the Internet, they will gravitate in this direction. </p> <p>Our refreshed brand will not appeal to everyone, and that’s OK. We are not here to win the competition but to make sure it’s as fair as possible, and that the players on the field know all of the rules and feel free to make their own decisions. We want an Internet where everyone has an equal chance to succeed. That’s victory for us and for all. </p> <p>As long as Firefox continues to improve its performance, stability, and independence-minded features, people may use it strictly for its utility.

      "content": "<p>What if you threw a party and nobody came?</p><p>That was a lurking concern I had about this Open Design initiative, and I needn’t have feared.</p><p>A global cross-section of designers, advisers, and critics has walked through the open doors of our brand refresh. Each comment, whether insightful, challenging, tart or sweet, demonstrates that someone cares about the future of Mozilla.</p><p>A big learning from this give-and-take has been that many people, even longtime fans, conflate and mix-up Mozilla and Firefox. We can’t blame them, really. As an organization, we have done a poor job distinguishing our parent brand Mozilla from our high-achieving brand-child Firefox.</p><p>Mozilla is not a browser; it <i>makes</i> a browser. Albeit one that has grown so popular, it casts a shadow over its progenitor. Mozilla also creates core technologies that improve the Internet, challenges growing corporate consolidation in legislatures and courts, educates people about their power on the Web, and sparks understanding of the Internet as a global public resource.</p><p>We don’t do this work alone. Often we convene, support, and collaborate to produce a positive outcome. When we take the lead, we invite others to join us. This open design process is one example.</p><p>What we haven’t done as well is generate understanding about the work we do and why. That’s changing. As we prepare to reintroduce Mozilla to the world, our brand identity and experience will be important components of that understanding.</p><p><b>Active Listening </b></p><p>What have we distilled from feedback on our seven initial territories?</p><p>Many feel that “For All” and “For Good” on their own are too abstract and insubstantial. Heading in either direction might lead to a brand identity that’s not distinct enough from other social benefit organizations in the world. Pairing one or both of these ideas with a more active option, however, is worthy of further study.</p><p>Several commenters regarded “The Guide,” as too abstract, not capturing our ability and responsibility to create a better Internet and lead people on the path toward it. We’re not working on the Internet as an abstract principle, but because we want it to empower people.</p><p>On their own, “The Protector” and “The Fight” come across as too defensive. Mozilla is not just about preserving the present and celebrating the past. We are about creating the conditions for future growth and opportunity of the Internet. Paired with ideas drawn from other directions however, describing the threats to the Internet may be necessary to help people understand what’s at stake.</p><p>In some comments we also found references to Mozilla’s past and future role as a champion for the boundless Internet. This sentiment reinforced our own realization that we’d under-emphasized the optimism and wonder ahead of us as the Internet grows.</p><p>We also received great some reminders:</p><ul><li>Several reviewers called us to task for being too America-centric either in our language or political references. We will try harder to be aware of our biases and build a brand that works around the world.</li><li>One contributor suggested that constructing a dynamic, living brand would be helpful for encouraging global adoption, and we agree.</li><li>Another reminded us that we need to build this brand together, not impose it on our millions of followers.</li></ul><p>And that’s what we’ll continue to do. Thanks for walking by our side. And if you’re new to this, welcome to the party.</p>",

We gathered some useful comments online, plus some invaluable feedback internally – especially about upping the positivity and doing more with the whole principle of ‘open’.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-139\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/thegoodfight-300x280.jpg\" alt=\"thegoodfight\" width=\"300\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/thegoodfight-300x280.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/thegoodfight-600x561.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/thegoodfight-1000x934.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/thegoodfight.jpg 1477w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">So now we’re ready to share our final five thematic options.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Taking a stand</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Right from the off there’s been a desire to play to Mozilla’s non-profit strengths, amplify its voice and turn up the volume. Previously this overall direction was more about what Mozilla were fighting against – we’ve turned this to be more about what Mozilla are fighting for.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Theme 1: The Good Fight</strong><br>Sometimes you have to fight for what you believe in. Mozilla believes in an open, equal, accessible Internet – for everyone. One that makes us active creators, not passive receivers. One that works for the benefit of the many, not the few. We’re ready to take a stand, link arms with others who share our view of the future, and provide tools and opportunities for those who need them. You can wish for a better web, and a better world. Or you can get involved and make it happen.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-137\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/fortheinternetofpeople_2-1-300x288.jpg\" alt=\"fortheinternetofpeople_2\" width=\"300\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/fortheinternetofpeople_2-1-300x288.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/fortheinternetofpeople_2-1-600x575.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/fortheinternetofpeople_2-1-1000x959.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/fortheinternetofpeople_2-1-32x32.jpg 32w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/fortheinternetofpeople_2-1.jpg 1478w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"><br><strong>Positive impact on humanity</strong><br>Another realization after our first stage of work was that we’d become too mired in geek-speak and weren’t successfully explaining how a healthy Internet helps everyone. So theme two concentrates on people, not machines.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Theme 2: For the Internet of People</strong><br>Mozilla believes that the Internet should work for people – and the best way to achieve that is to give people the power to shape the Internet. At its best, the Internet is humanity’s greatest invention. It has the ability to connect human minds and free human potential on a scale never seen before. But we need to keep it open, always. We need to distribute power widely, not divide it narrowly. We need to build bridges, not walls. The future of the Internet is amazing, as long as it remains the Internet of People.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-136\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/chooseopen-300x255.jpg\" alt=\"chooseopen\" width=\"300\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/chooseopen-300x255.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/chooseopen-600x510.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/chooseopen-1000x851.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"><br><strong>About ‘Open’</strong><br>We had a sneaking suspicion that we’d buried the whole debate about ‘open’ too deep in the first tranche of work. So the third theme addresses this head on.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Theme 3: Choose open</strong><br>The future of the internet can be open, or closed. We choose open. We choose an internet that is equal and accessible by default. Open to ideas, open to collaboration, open to everyone. But it isn’t a choice we can make alone. An open web is something we all have to choose together. And it involves many other choices. The tools we use. The products we support. The way we behave online. Those choices can be complex, but the guiding principle should always be simple. Choose open.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-135\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/betterinternetstartshere-300x284.jpg\" alt=\"betterinternetstartshere\" width=\"300\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/betterinternetstartshere-300x284.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/betterinternetstartshere-600x567.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/betterinternetstartshere-1000x946.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"><br><strong>The pioneers</strong><br>In our discussions at the Mozilla London All Hands meeting, and since, we’ve been talking about Mozilla’s pioneering role in the early development of the Internet, and ever since. So theme four looks hard at this (and brings back some of that grit as well, just for good measure).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Theme 4: With you from the start</strong><br>Mozilla was, is, and always will be on the side of those who want a better, freer, more open Internet. In the early days, we were among those helping to embed principles of openness and accessibility into the web’s DNA. Now those principles matter more than ever. We need an Internet that works wonders for the many, not just the few. We need to stand by the founding ideals of the Internet, and carry them forward into new products, platforms, conversations, and great ideas. We’ve been with you from the start. And we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/mavericksunited-297x300.jpg\" alt=\"mavericksunited\" width=\"297\" height=\"300\"><br><strong>The maker community</strong><br>Last, but definitely not least, we wanted a clearer idea that summed up the dynamic online community worldwide that Mozilla represents. Now that we’ve met hundreds of them in person, we wanted something that verbally did them justice.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Theme 5: Mavericks, united</strong><br>The Internet belongs to mavericks and independent spirits. It’s the sum total of millions of people working towards something greater than themselves. We believe the independent spirit that founded the Internet is vital to its future. But being independent doesn’t mean being alone. We bring together free thinkers, makers and doers from around the world. We create the tools, platforms, conversations, and momentum to make great things happen. We’re not waiting for the future of the Internet to be decided by others. It’s ours to invent.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What’s next? Well, in parallel to agreeing all of the above, we’ve started the design routes that go with each one. With a bit of luck, we’ll be ready to share our first thoughts on that very soon.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I will give a review to each one in the order above.</p> <p>I quite like The-Eye, some might find it like it is always watching, I´d try to make it clear that Mozilla is trying to care for you and if you go into private mode looks away or closes in a quick animation. The typo is also quite bold and could make it stand out with the strong yellow. The whole concept around the use/ application should be rethought a bit for clarity. It looks the most stable for sure and could easily be branded worldwide and be recognizable.</p> <p>Tribal is an interesting idea, with the whole aspect of community, it kind of reminds me of Vaio  though. I love the use of the name in a creative way and the reuse of the same elements, though they should always stay the same, don’t use new or modified letters, use the ones you have. Recognizing and global reach will be a hard one with this one, it’s not instant, it’s a slow approach logo (what I mean by that is that you have to get used to it over a long time to really recognize and appreciate the connections).</p> <p>Please don’t use the elevator one at all, it’s kind of terrible, colors, shapes and meaning seem to far off to be any good. I don’t see any value in this one.</p> <p>The most technical yet is Moz://a, love it for its clever use of characters and meaning, it’s hard to see this one outside of community driven aspects that have a deep connection to the brand. It also may seem like a silicon valley pun like Tumblr or Flickr. Hard to market to a bigger audience because of those limitations and quite boring appearance.</p> <p>Wireframe looks interesting, is too common for it to be special, just look at Watch Dogs or any other tech company that wants to be edgy. Everyone seems to love the wireframe, most forget that it is so common that it is interchangeable with anything else. Interesting animations could be possible, the limitations of not being recognizable kill the concept for me.</p> <p>Impossible M is a retro modern approach alla MTV with the changing logo fillings, it feels retro but also new because it hasn’t been done for a while, instead of giving it a plain filling this one lets the brand explore more of the day to day basis (Google Doodle). Memorable for sure if there is interesting content provided inside the logo and if it tells a story or conveys an emotion, if not it will fail quickly and become another 3D like letter (Medium). Keep the edginess and embrace it, separate the Logo from the name and make them stand for themselves, the strong point is the interchangeable voice the logo can speak, use it to your advantage and show that you are always on the pulse of time.</p> <p>Flik-Flak looks promising, in animation or not, but there is just to much going on for my taste, maybe try to make it simpler and always convey it with movement to show the deepness of the ideas that are put with it. Colors should also be rethought and be chosen to fit together better and in a more defining way, maybe a 2 color variant, with black and violet, which would stand out for sure and make it one of the few with that color that could embrace it. Violet would be a goof fit for several reasons amongst them being different and conveying a sense of thrust that goes along with it.</p> <p>Those are my quick opinions on those concepts, hope I could help out.</p> <p>Sebastiano Develli</p>",

The connector one is by far the most interesting, but there’s just too much going on for a logo, it would look awesome with a ton of simplification. “Open-Button” more like generic logo, if it didn’t say Mozilla I would’ve never thought. The protocol one is great, but not what I would call “appropriate”. It’s too “simple”, when comparing to the simple old mozilla text, it’s like putting the IE logo side by side with Edge logo. Moreover it looks like :/ The wireframe one is decent, but just like the first one, not really what fits the brand the best (IMHO), but it’s closer to home. If it is chosen I won’t go screaming “Mozilla isn’t what it used to be”. After that we have windows 98. And the last one looks like a cutout, I don’t even get it.</p>",

However, I spend a lot of time working with teens and I can promise you they will see something other than an eye, especially if you use the “All Hands” guy.  If you are going to go with that option, you need to change the pupil.  For the-Eye I also feel the lettering is too thick and overpowering. </p> <p>The exact opposite problem is happening with Moz://a.  There isn’t enough style to the letters.  I don’t think it needs heaps more, but it is a bit plain at the moment.  It should feel like someone designed it, right now it looks like someone just picked the first typeface they saw.</p> <p>These are my two top choices because they are fairly simple and with a few tweaks could be instantly recognisable. Looking at these logos I tried to think of which ones would look good on a button or sticker.  The others are too complex, too much, and too old-fashioned.

I would prefer to either have something nice to say or nothing at all, but I also don’t want us to make a mistake with our brand, so I’m adding my say.</p> <p>Let me try being more constructive:  Perhaps instead of taking the word ‘Mozilla’ and trying to brand that, perhaps the exercise should be branding the concept of our mission in visual language.  I realize the wireframe and Flik-Flak are trying to do that, but building 3d shapes does not intuitively translate to protecting the open web and making it accessible and empowering to users.  I don’t know what image or icon could encompass all of that, but I do know we haven’t solved it yet.  I think a Foxkeh face would probably be more successful, in my mind, than any of the above examples, with the caveat that it would tie Mozilla even further with the fox imagery.

Also dinos are just cool.<br> The protocol design feels bland and soulless. The foldy Flik-Flak logo is way too busy and complicated. It has too much character and is over the top.<br>  I think the tribal design has a cool circuit kinda feel but when it’s the letters in Mozilla it looks pretty bad.<br> The impossible M is too dull/boring.<br>  The interconnected M logo is decent but reminds me of the EFF more than Mozilla.<br> The Open-Button is pretty cute but doesn’t feel like “mozilla” as much as the T-Rex eye logo.</p>",

And the fact that the lines hide the word “Mozilla” in plain sight can be a sort of easter egg which gives it that special touch (like the FedEx logo).</p>",

      "content": "<p>On our open logo design journey together, we’ve arrived at an inflection point. Today our effort—equal parts open crit, performance art piece, and sociology experiment—takes its logical next step, moving from words to visuals. A roomful of reviewers lean forward in their chairs, ready to weigh in on what we’ve done so far. Or so we hope.</p><p>We’re ready. The work with our agency partner, johnson banks, has great breadth and substantial depth for first-round concepts (possibly owing to our rocket-fast timeline). Our initial response to the work has, we hope, helped make it stronger and more nuanced. We’ve jumped off this cliff together, holding hands and bracing for the splash.</p><p>Each of the seven concepts we’re sharing today leads with and emphasizes a particular facet of the Mozilla story. From paying homage to our paleotechnic origins to rendering us as part of an ever-expanding digital ecosystem, from highlighting our global community ethos to giving us a lift from the quotidian elevator Open-Button, the concepts express ideas about Mozilla in clever and unexpected ways.</p><p>There are no duds in the mix. The hard part will be deciding among them, and this is a good problem to have.</p><p>We have our opinions about these paths forward, our early favorites among the field. But for now we’re going to sit quietly and listen to what the voices from the concentric rings of our community—Mozillians, Mozilla fans, designers, technologists, and beyond—have to say in response about them.</p><h2><b>Tag, you’re it. </b></h2><p>Here’s what we’d like you to do, if you’re up for it. Have a look at the seven options and tell us what you think. <strong>To make comments about an individual direction and to see its full system, click on its image below.</strong></p><p>Which of these initial visual expressions best captures what Mozilla means to you? Which will best help us tell our story to a youthful, values-driven audience? Which brings to life the Mozilla personality: Gutsy, Independent, Buoyant, For Good?</p><p>If you want to drill down a level, also consider which design idea:</p><ul><li>Would resonate best around the world?</li><li>Has the potential to show off modern digital technology?</li><li>Is most scalable to a variety of Mozilla products, programs, and messages?</li><li>Would stand the test of time (well…let’s say 5-10 years)?</li><li>Would make people take notice and rethink Mozilla?</li></ul><p>This is how we’ve been evaluating each concept internally over the past week or so. It’s the framework we’ll use as we share the work for qualitative and quantitative feedback from our key audiences.</p><p>How you deliver your feedback is up to you: writing comments on the blog, uploading a sketch or a mark-up, shooting a carpool karaoke video….bring it on. We’ll be taking feedback on this phase of work for roughly the next two weeks.</p><p>If you’re new to this blog, a few reminders about what we’re <i>not</i> doing. We are not crowdsourcing the final design, nor will there be voting. We are not asking designers to work on spec. We welcome all feedback but make no promise to act on it all (even if such a thing were possible).</p><p>From here, we’ll reduce these seven concepts to three, which we’ll refine further based partially on feedback from people like you, partially on what our design instincts tell us, and very much on what we need our brand identity to communicate to the world. These three concepts will go through a round of consumer testing and live critique in mid-September, and we’ll share the results here. We’re on track to have a final direction by the end of September.</p><p>We trust that openness will prevail over secrecy and that we’ll all learn something in the end. Thanks for tagging along.</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/design-route-a-the-eye/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-147 size-full\"

Lastly, I’m looking at how creative can you be with the design. What you have with the-Eye is very versatile while keeping core design in tact.</p>",

That could work too, but that identity does not offer much flexibility into the different projects of Mozilla, and I don’t consider the pictograms as a big part of the identity. They typography of M:// is flawed since it’s using Helvetica heavy – not only a proprietary typeface and not open at all, but also would make the wordmark look too generic, just like some everyday brands you see at the supermarket. Therefore an open and more characteristic typeface, or a set of lettering specifically designed would give that identity a big boost.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi Tim,</p> <p>It’s great to be able to see this process unfolding. I can’t wait to see where we end up. I don’t want to detract from such early concepts, but none of the concepts feel imbued with the Mozilla’s humanity or attitude. Thus far, I’m left furtively hoping that we’ll excavate The Dino.</p> <p>Impossible M is gorgeous, but lacks character. It mostly reminds me of the exhibit advertisements I see on the side of my local modern art museum. The animated treatment seems to take more than a little inspiration from MTV’s early identity.</p> <p>The developer in me loves Protocol, but I also wonder if it hews a bit too closely to Slashdot and cURL’s logos, or if it might be mistaken for Moz, the SEO company. It’s also interesting that Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Opera all hide the ‘://’ protocol delimiter in their address bars. Tying our identity to a disappearing symbol might not be the best long-term bet.</p> <p>I love how Wireframe World’s perspective can flip depending on which faces are shaded, but… where’s the humanity? Or the Mozilla? Substitute “MoMA” for “Mozilla” and you’d still have a believable mark.</p> <p>The Connector is lovely in a 90’s kind of way, but it’s also an illegible wordmark. The tiled pattern is even worse on that account. And while the MozFest, All Hands, MDN, and Maker Party logos look quite nice alongside each other, they’ll never be presented so close together in practice. Without that proximity for immediate comparison, I don’t think I’d recognize them as part of the same brand.</p> <p>Nothing about The Open-Button speaks “Open” or “Web” or “Mozilla” to me. I get a very “bloomberg.com” vibe from the typeface and colors.</p> <p>Flik-Flak is super fantastic, but it still falls “flat” for me, again like something I’d see on the side of my local modern art museum. It’s just too… thin and constructed. How would it have a voice? Where’s the warmth and emotional attachment? Would a shape that complex even be recognizable from afar, or in black and white?</p> <p>The-Eye immediately reminds me of caution tape, construction sites (Caterpillar!), and the evil Eye of Sauron.  Oddly enough, I also can’t find a past depiction of our Dino with reptilian pupils. Go figure.</p> <p>Good luck! I’m eagerly following along,<br> -Dan</p> <p>PS: Seriously, everything about the eyeballs freaks me out. The proposed MDN logo could double as a Lovecraftian horror. Nobody wants to open a pitch black book and find an unblinking, eldritch eye staring directly into their soul. Or go to a (Maker) Party filled with nine other scrutinizing eyes. Eep.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Oof. I like where ya’lls thematic thinking is going, but none of these seem very strong.</p> <p>My initial reaction is that there’s only one really viable concept here: The Open-Button. The fact that only one option seems viable to me is worrisome. But let’s take it from the top.</p> <p>The-Eye: I actually like this one in the way it harkens back to the dinosaur. As a long-time contributor, it feels like it harkens back to our history but in a new, modern way. Nostalgia is a trap. This is a bad justification for a logo. We need a logo for the world, not insiders. Besides this, it feels very aggressively scary, authoritarian, and inhuman. The ‘All Hand’s variant looks like a cop telling me to stop. The Maker Party variant reminds me of insect eyes, or a hive of some kind. Generally, this makes me think my every move will be surveilled.</p> <p>The Connector: Very post modern. It looks random, and it took me a few minutes to see it’s kind of a wordmark sorta thing. It reminds me of the MIT Media Lab logo which I’m also very very much not a fan of. This is better than theirs though because colors and rounded edges. <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_mit_media_lab_by_pentagram.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_mit_media_lab_by_pentagram.php</a> </p> <p>The Open-Button: Reminds me of media player UI. Is it a button I can press? Will it play music? Is it like the iPod click wheel? As far as logos go, it’s unique and I think would lead to strong brand recognition. I’m not sure it immediately says/means anything, but the more I look at it the more it’s starting to make sense. It has a lot of potential as an animated logo and maybe even a functional UI thing of some kind. I want this on my hardware, I want it to glow, and I want to touch it. I really &lt;3 where this is going. I don't think it's ready yet and would like to see it developed more.</p> <p>Protocol: Generic, and too developer-centric rather than user-centric. Just like the-Eye, this almost conveys the opposite of our mission.</p> <p>Wireframe: Very noisy. I didn't even see the M at first. I'm not sure what this is trying to say. Is Mozilla creating a social network? Are we becoming a data analytics company? There could be something that works here, but some of the lines and dots need differentiation. I'd like to see iteration on this concept.</p> <p>The Impossible M and Flik-Flak: Were these from the Alphabet (Google's parent company) reject pile? They look generic, and already dated. The former looks old, and the latter looks like it's going to be old in like 5 minutes.</p> <p>The most viable options here seem to be under the categories of 'Choose Open' and 'With you from the start'. I'd like to see these three options iterated upon.</p> <p>I'd toss the rest and go back to the drawing board with each of their respective themes (which are all great btw!) Each of these themes deserves at least one good option.</p> <p>I'd like to get some feedback from some non-mozillian non-techies. May come back with additional feedback from other peeps I share this with.</p>",

The-Eye is one of those you put into a pitch to pad it out because it’s kind of a neat idea but knowing it’ll never get picked – far too many negative connotations and ugly as sin. One thing though – the typography that sits next to each logo – that’s the bit that really needs the work. Nearly every one uses the same, very dull, and slightly clunky font, (just use Helvetica if you must, at least it’s nicely proportioned) which doesn’t sit well with any if the logo designs. The wireframe version is the only one where the type and logo seems to have been considered as a whole, but as others have said, it’s a bit generic.</p>",

I don’t know if that would change reactions much, but it almost always helps to read those narratives and to see the various explorations and applications. I see the sentence in parentheses where you’ve invited/instructed people to do so, but you might want to make that more obvious and explicit. I’d make it mandatory!</p> <p>Also, I’m curious why a single narrative wasn’t agreed before beginning the design exploration? I understand that Mozilla (like all organizations) is multi-faceted. But it feels like Mozilla has yet to decide what role they want to play in the world, or at least which of the 5 they want to major in. Perhaps the design exploration is a way to help make this strategic direction more clear? I have to imagine that some of the confusion and dissatisfaction in the comments is from a lack of clarity and agreement on the strategic narrative.</p> <p>To answer the specific questions in your post:</p> <p>Which of these initial visual expressions best captures what Mozilla means to you? – Conceptually: The Connector and Wireframe World. I think they both get at the idea of openness, but specifically through the lens of being open to a COMMUNITY that has the power and ability to shape and reshape the web and make it what they want. Of the two, I think Connector is more unique and original (visually). I feel like Wireframe World has been done before. But with Connector, I have the same concern others have expressed: it might be a little much. I wonder if you can explore a less “tribal” expression that perhaps borrows symbols from programming code instead of circuitry for a softer look and a more recognizable/resonant visual language? </p> <p>Which will best help us tell our story to a youthful, values-driven audience? – It depends on what value you think is most important to this youthful audience. Personally, I think the idea of something that is “powered by the people” or community-driven really taps into the whole spirit of the sharing economy, collaborative consumption, etc. Pardon the buzzwords. And therefore, I think The Connector tells this story best. The younger the generation, the less concerned they seem to be about privacy issues. I think they care about two things: 1) social good, and 2) being empowered to make. Of the two, caring about social good feels like a higher-order value.</p> <p>Which brings to life the Mozilla personality: Gutsy, Independent, Buoyant, For Good?</p> <p>Gusty: The-Eye, Wireframe World, The Impossible M<br> Independent: The Connector, Open-Button, Wireframe World, The Impossible M, Flik-Flak<br> Buoyant: The Connector, The Impossible M (I believe The-Eye has potential to be more cheerful and optimistic without going all purple and Barney on us)<br> For Good: The Connector, The-Eye (again, with some tweaks to feel slightly less aggressive/big brother-y/less Georgia O’Keefe-y ;-)</p> <p>Overall, I feel The Connector speaks to all but Gutsy. The Impossible M speaks to all but For Good. The-Eye has potential to speak to all but Independent. </p> <p>Which design idea would resonate best around the world? – It depends on the primary audience. If it’s the masses, then The Connector. If it’s a pure developer community, then Protocol. FWIW, I think Protocol is brilliant and clever, but a bit boring tbh. That said, Connector doesn’t exactly feel safe and secure. It has so much frenetic energy. I somehow want to infuse Connector with a bit of the calm and order in Protocol.</p> <p>Which design idea has the potential to show off modern digital technology? – The Connector, Wireframe World, and Flik-Flak. But what do you mean by ‘modern digital technology’ and how does that apply to Mozilla? When I think of modern and digital I think of flexibility and agility, and I think of systems. Connector, Wireframe World, and Flik-Flak communicate those to me.</p> <p>Which design idea is most scalable to a variety of Mozilla products, programs, and messages? – Originally, I was going to say the same three as above: Connector, WW, and FF. Because they’re such flexible and dynamic identities, you can create infinite sub-brands and icons for all the current and future products, programs, and messages. But, one of the problems with these identities is that while they are incredible flexible, they don’t necessarily create memorable sub-brands and icons. Everything ends up sort of looking the same. The-Eye, however, does a great job at creating sub-brands and icons because its simplicity and more limited nature forces a bit more creativity and personality. I love the executions for All Hands, Maker Party, Speaking Out, and Privacy. They’re fun, clever, clear, and memorable. Much more so than some of the more flexible—and arguably scalable—identities. </p> <p>Which design idea would stand the test of time (well…let’s say 5-10 years)? 5 years? All of them should be okay for the next 5. Although, The Impossible M and Wireframe World feel a bit too trendy—especially the former. 10 years? None. But that’s probably a good thing, no? Maybe Protocol. But it really feels too proud of its past. It feels just a bit too insular to allow for 10 years of growth and innovation.</p> <p>Which design idea would make people take notice and rethink Mozilla? – The-Eye, The Connector, Protocol, Wireframe World.</p> <p>Overall, I like the concept behind The Connector but think it needs to be more simple and refined. My close second would be The-Eye if you can solve for its various problems.</p> <p>Sorry for posting the longest comment ever. Obnoxious.</p>",

Which at least the-Eye of Sauron image (as others have compared it) doesn’t. And the Moz://a while does appeal to the geek in me, won’t help make others feel we’re necessarily good for them (nor is it easy for all to read) — And I dislike the M:// shorthand there.</p> <p>Personally I think what would help me is a few more, drastically different Proof Of Concepts in terms of logo art, potentially even from a different outsourced firm or two (if these are all the same firm) to get alternative proposals on the table, so that I and the greater community at large, can help inform what *is* our logo in a meaningful way. I’m not sure if this is an option though.</p> <p>Maybe some greater prose on *why* you and others felt these logo proposals were standout, how they came to be, etc would be useful to me as well. What do you feel they represent, were there alternative designs of these things in earlier stages where they could have made sense taken a slightly different way? Things like the “artsy vertical Mozilla” how do you see it portrayed on banners/products/websites/advertisements? </p> <p>A brand re-image is a hard thing to get right, comes with a great deal of scrutiny and stop-energy and a wrong re-image can hurt the brand long term. I don’t envy your job here, but I do hope we can come up with something I can feel proud in displaying as “Mozilla” without feeling dread that I’d have to explain it repeatedly, in a greater detail/pain than I already do with the Dino/plain-text-Mozilla.</p>",

I am not sure it would be hard for people to read, worth testing. I would guess it would be easier for the nontechie to read as their brains wouldn’t recognize the characters for what they are, and probably see them as the letters they represent.</p> <p>Other than that I think we need to be careful of trying too hard to represent specific concepts.

The connector is the concept which I feel has the most potential as it shows a certain cohesion amongst the variety of letters. They are all part to a singular word, just as we are to the Mozilla community. I do not like the way it has been translated however into the various countries and I think its somewhat too friendly – It needs to be refined, and in such a way that it reflects a company that is for the people, for everyone – but that is professional and embues quality, the hard earned foundation and experience of the brand has to be seen – dont forget to show that you’ve done the hard miles, people need to see that.</p>",

The dots and lines one seems very generic. The “with you from the start” one is the nicest design, but I think would confuse and alienate many people, and be something that pushes people away.  Most web users don’t understand what that notation means and printed urls don’t generally use it any more. I am not sure what to say here, and want to like *something*, but I really don’t. Frankly, none of these look representative of the company and its products or philosophy, or the “brand”, to me.</p>",

So much fun to watch and engage in.<br> “Good Fight” – I REALLY wanted to like this one because it continues the dinosaur theme.  Originally I was thinking this could work with a color change but no matter how hard I try, I can’t get past the-Eye of Sauron and Monsters, Inc connection.  The “looking out for you” aspect just doesn’t come across.<br> “Connector” – Like the colors much better, but really find all the iterations of it too busy across products and projects and really didn’t see the “Mozilla” written out til someone mentioned in the comments.  Like the ability to localize w/ the flags though.<br> “Open-Button” – definitely my favorite of all of them.  Agree that it needs different colors though, reminds me of flickr.  I like the “open” button aspect, the “for the people” version, localization w/ flags, the iterations for different convenings, etc<br> “Protocol” – Like the look, like the iterations, would like to see more localization ideas.  LIke the icons you have going w/ it to demonstrate privacy, fight… leads to more customizability for different events, projects, etc.  I like how if folks don’t know it, and see the shortened version it’s an oppty for opening a discussion around “What does that mean?”  It hearkens to open web.  I know I’m harping, but color… please incorporate reds/oranges.  Use/tweak current moz font or similar to maintain continuity of brand?<br> “Wireframe” – Trying to find something I like or something constructive for wireframe, I got nothing.  Sorry.  It doesn’t speak Mozilla to me, it’s too busy for me, I see a jumble of lines not the “M”. Moving on.<br> “Impossible M” – Pretty similar to how I feel abt Wireframe.  It’s visceral on these two.  It looks dated.  Reminds me of an educational programming logo from 1970s… sorry can’t remember the name.  Not digging the switch between angular and curved w/ some of the iterations.  Also, colors.<br> “Flik-Flak” – love the colors.  Other than that, I find it busy, hard to see the “Mozilla”, not really grooving on any of the iterations for the different programs or events.  It speaks to me more than Wireframe or Impossible M but that’s about it.</p> <p>Overall… please think about color connection w/ history of Mozilla… reds, oranges, Use blues and add greens for contrast to reds &amp; oranges?<br> Would REALLY like something that brings the dinosaur in to maintain continuity between history and now.  (Dinosaur tail? snout? foot? definitely not the-Eye, though)</p>",

As somebody else has pointed out I’m puzzled by the choice of not leveraging Mozilla’s historical identity in any obvious way: for some reason the historical “red/white” palette has been ignored in all the drafts.</p> <p>Somebody has also pointed out that these drafts could be applied to any other company; for some of these drafts I do agree with this assestment; most notably “The Wireframe World”, “The Impossible M” and “Choose Open” are the most generic ones.</p> <p>If I were to pick one I’d probably go for Flik-Flak because of the resemblance with the beloved Dino. If I can offer a piece of advice: I’d strongly simplify its overall style with smoother lines and less sharp angles to give him an overall feeling of “trustwortiness”. The historical red/white color palette would surely balance that with a bit of our historical sense of “rebellion”. :-)</p> <p>About Dino: we mozillians are very fond of it. I’d be the happiest person on the planet to see it coming back in a fresh look. It means a lot for us mozillians, Mozilla and the web. As we look forward to Mozilla’s next challenges we should also keep tight on our roots and “a new Dino” might be the answer, IMHO.</p> <p>Of course all these are just my 2c.

Speaking to the Foxkeh face in particular (which, for those not in the know, is a Japanese mascot character created by the Mozilla Japan community around 2007), you’re right to recognize that conflating Mozilla with Firefox may not be the right path for either brand. We need a set of creative assets that can be deployed to represent Mozilla distinct from Firefox. Our exercise here is to lean into different facets of the whole Mozilla (openness, technology, participation/community, our heritage, etc). We’ll continue to refine from these first-round ideas. If you haven’t already done so, I encourage you to read earlier posts on how we identified and refined the narrative territories that underlie the designs. Thanks again!</p>",

Simple, and the “://” ties into the web. Old school. People might be unsure how to pronounce it? The “M://” abbreviation is hard to attach meaning to, though, and looks like an MS-DOS prompt.</p> <p>Wireframe: Doesn’t resonate with me. Very busy, with the knobby vertices and overlapping edges. Took me a while to realize the wireframe can be read as a 3d “M”. The angled “Mozilla” sticks out awkwardly.</p> <p>Impossible M: I don’t like the colour and texture choices at all. Even if they were removed or improved, the shape just feels awkward to me.</p> <p>Flik-Flak: Cute, but very busy and complex. Again, took me some time to realize the shapes spell “Mozilla”.

I think it is really a good idea. However, when abbreviated, it seems like “MILL” (M://) – this is a minor infraction in my opinion. </p> <p>The WIREFRAME WORLD is flexible!

I think it is not bold enough. It doesn’t take up lots of space and so reminds me of a lack of – something (ie: innovation, dedication… clearly not what I see in Mozilla).</p> <p>FLIK FLAK away! It’s a neat design, looks great for animation. I have trouble seeing the MOZILLA hidden in the folds. It doesn’t seem to fit the screen very well. </p> <p>Overall, I am a PROTOCOL supporter!

That said, whilst both have great potential in the build out of the brand, I do see their approach as an expected one.</p> <p>To speak of the others I did not select, Protocol, Wireframe World seem too simple, lacking in potential. The Impossible M to me does not represent Mozilla’s mission or purpose (I almost see it as being more suited to a printing company), whereas whilst I understand The-Eye returns to Mozilla’s earlier days, I was never personally taken by the Raptor, which I was never able to associate with what Mozilla does.</p>",

I’m well aware that blue is the tone used to express trust and security, but I don’t think that it applies to mozilla, as the commitment for security is already well known; I would preferably focus more on expressing the excitement of the browsing experience and so stick with the red/warm tones.</p> <p>For the same reason, please avoid absolutely “the-Eye”. It definitely look like an evil eye. It’s shouting distrust on every single curve of the logo.</p> <p>“The connector” is interesting, but it looks like a touristic logo. Too much complicated (and too many colors). But I like the font used to write the plain text part of the logo.</p> <p>“Choose Open” is sad. Absolutely sad. It looks like a logo for the remote control of a tv set. Or for a music platform everyone will forget very soon, though the idea of making it the base for an emoticon was very smart.</p> <p>“The protocol” is the one I predict you will choose in the end. It’s moderate and highly expressive of the fact you are a… software house. I don’t like the abbreviation and I think you should never use it in your official documents, in order to respect readability and accessibility purposes, though it was a very cool code.</p> <p>“The wireframe world” is very interesting. Looks very much like the logo of an architect and gives a strong idea of the fact you are a solid and creative foundation, but I think it has the defect of not having the name on a horizontal line. Plus the black color is a bit heavy.</p> <p>“The impossible M” is my other favorite with Protocol. But again I don’t like the colors. And I don’t like the font used to write Mozilla. I would go for something more rounded to express empathy towards the user.</p> <p>“The flick-flack” is very experimental and pleasant. But… it’s totally unreadable.</p> <p>You will never do, but in the end I think you should come back to the creation step and do it again.</p> <p>—</p> <p>Anyway I really think that the old simple text without the dyno was enough.

Wireframe: Lazy<br> 6. The impossible M: Again, this is a look to the past not to the future, this logo could be done in a Pc 80386 in the early 90s using Logo programming language ( if you are old enough, you shoul know about this DOS software)<br> 7.

I find it too heavy, and, like some other comments, the-Eye mostly makes me think of 1984 and mass control.</p> <p>Connector : the idea is good but the result is not good. It looks more like a maze than like connectors and it is not readable.</p> <p>Open-Button : this one is quite good and closer to the target. A simple, graphic and easily recognizable logo design. I think you should try with other colours to be sure it really looks like open / on (perhaps use one darker colour for the circle and a brighter color for the rest, not only the bottom). I’m not fan of the pink colour (but I don’t like pink in general).</p> <p>Protocol : This one is also quite good. I like the principle and :// that really match the web. But I find the colours are too bland especially the Moz://a with two blue. The blue on the girl t-shirt example is better.</p> <p>Wireframe: again a good idea with a bad result that don’t make sense and some declinations are horrible.</p> <p>Impossible M : The third one I think are quite good. But I would remove the colours and effects on the side and only keep the lines. In the declinations, please remove these blinky and outdated colours and gradients, else the pictos for webmakers, privacy … really works and match the logo design.</p> <p>Flik-Flak : I don’t understand this one. it doesn’t work, is not readable and too confusing.</p> <p>In general, I think you should focus on a less is more principle with a simple graphic logo with a set of simple colours and take care of the font set.<br> Also, in most of the cases, the logo variations per country changes too much the logo. I would avoid it.</p> <p>Hope this will help.<br> Cheers</p>",

That’s the cart before the horses.</p> <p>So what you get is what’s fashionable, and will look dated next year. You might want to look for more seasoned designers, who are no longer as interested in showing off how “on fleek” they are, and more interested in _solving your problem_.</p> <p>And that’s the crux: What is the problem? What actually needs to be solved? Just naming a few feel-good values does not a brand strategy make. What about the brand’s audience, category, competitive context, history, position, direction, benefits, promise, archetypes, voice, tone, pace, posture, key messages? Are these defined? </p> <p>Abraham Lincoln once said “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” I recommend you hit pause on this premature effort to judge a few arbitrary solutions, and instead engage the community in sharpening the problem. What are the brand’s context, objective, and attributes? Once these are defined, you’ll have some real criteria for evaluating visual solutions.</p>",

But here’s my thoughts…</p> <p>A: The-Eye – Fine for a Godzilla logo but doesn’t seem to align with what I’d expect for a company like Mozilla</p> <p>B: Connector – Interesting and opens things up for a much wider brand identity however it feels too childish.</p> <p>C: Open-Button – Not especially a fan of the colour scheme and though I understand it’s not been given the time to be refined it looks the most rushed of the lot. I’m not sure the icongraphy is going to be easily understood without explanation</p> <p>D: Protocol – My preferred option of those presented. I think the font could do with some work and be softened in come way, or possibly more closely related to common coding fonts. It elevates the logo beyond only type without the need for any icongraphy that often tends to overcomplicate a logo.</p> <p>F: Wireframe &amp; G: Flik-Flak – Both of these are just too complex and busy. The Flik-Flak logo especially is just too complex and not clear.</p> <p>E: Impossible M – Everything about this looks retro, especially with the neon colours. While these have become prominant again in certain industries it just serves to date the logo even before it’s started and seems to look backwards rather than forwards.</p> <p>With the exception of the Protocol option none of these, in my view, offer anything more than the existing logo and surely there is no point in making a change unless this change brings something better. The Protocol seems like a good starting point but does need further development to warrant replacing the existing logo.</p>",

Here’s text from a poster we shared at the June All Hands meeting in London with regards to the dino: </p> <p>What about the dino head?</p> <p>Created by artist Shepherd Fairey, later known as the illustrator for<br> the Obama HOPE poster, the Mozilla dino head logo was retired from<br> public view in 2013. Although it lives on in on MDN and communications within the Mozilla family, it’s unlikely to rise to become the Mozilla logo again.</p> <p>As lovable as this paleo mascot is, as a logo it doesn’t help explain Mozilla’s role in the world. A great logo is both distinctive and descriptive, and the dino head leads to heavily toward the former. The dino will always be invited to Friends &amp; Family Day.</p>",

The black and yellow does not help.<br> I get the «&nbsp;watch out for you&nbsp;» sentiment but making a connection to this logo is more of a intellectual process, whereas the evil eye is a gut feeling, instantaneous like a reflex.</p> <p>Two eyes might help shifting from dictator to Internet’s friendly Sully. Or teeth (see t-shirt).<br> Not convinced this would be the right look anyway. It does take Mozilla’s history into account though. And you could argue that it makes sense to look like a friendly bestiary when most people knows you for something called Firefox.<br> I suspect that the designers at johnson banks knows it and that this route is made public as a «&nbsp;let’s check what people see in this one&nbsp;», that’s the whole point about the open design process.</p> <p>#### The Connector<br> Clear winner for me.<br> Strong concept and execution that embrace the values of Mozilla in a broad non-geeky way.<br> It has an Olympics feel in it (in a good way) which says a lot about celebrating humanism and human potentials.<br> It also takes multiple shapes without looking forced, making it flexible, even more coherent with the concept and very expressive (the «&nbsp;Maker Party&nbsp;» version is spot on).<br> The black background version is a node to NeXT, nice touch for an internet related entity like Mozilla.</p> <p>The «&nbsp;Developer Network&nbsp;» one (and «&nbsp;All Hands&nbsp;» one, to a lesser extent) is really subpar compared to the others.</p> <p>Not so found about the Privacy, Open Systems etc.<br> They look kinda random:</p> <p>– Privacy works in an (good) obvious way.<br> – Open Systems works by comparison to Privacy but does not make much sense alone.<br> – Web Literacy happens to form a «&nbsp;W&nbsp;» but is the only one depicted by a letter which feels like «&nbsp;that’s the only idea we had&nbsp;».<br> – Speaking Out may be some kind of open mouth. It mostly feels like «&nbsp;we had to pick a symbol from the logo, so…&nbsp;»</p> <p>Taking these symbols (if they are needed at all) from parts of the logo doesn’t add much and is far too restrictive.<br> It’s a solid starting point with lots of obvious ways to tweak it in its current form and see if it feels better (colors, thickness, ends and joins shape, backgrounds… ). The stroke width could use some work to look correct. Right now, the «&nbsp;o&nbsp;» looks thicker and «&nbsp;m&nbsp;» thinner even though they are not.</p> <p>#### The Open-Button<br> The most uninspired of the whole to me. From the concept to the execution.<br> Yet another smiling figure. Smiling but looking sad.<br> It’s vague and says «&nbsp;digital tech stuff&nbsp;» in a dated way more than anything else.<br> It looks extracted from an 80’s signposting system: men’s room, information, locker, baby changing room.<br> Or an on/off switch on a tape recorder. Is it bad enough to switch Mozilla off ? I certainly hope not.<br> The type looks mismatched.<br> And why is the «&nbsp;Not closed&nbsp;» figure angry ?</p> <p>#### Protocol<br> Feels obvious in a geeky way.<br> Should Mozilla’s public face speak in a geeky way. I don’t think so. I think it should be broader.<br> It definitely works but I’m not convinced it’s the right tone for Mozilla to adopt when they need to make a statement of how great they still are to less and less people using Firefox.<br> The current execution looks really Microsoft-y. The blue doesn’t help.<br> The single color versions of the full name work better. They don’t emphasize M:// (or is it oza ?) and it’s not lacking.<br> The whole thing, with it’s safe blue and Helvetica light is too quiet.</p> <p>#### Wireframe<br> Very obvious execution of an obvious concept.<br> Not that it has to be a bad thing but in the particular case, the mariage of the symbol and the type really screams designer’s underground t-shirt brand if I may be caricatural. It sets it in a a trendy realm, which could be a very short-lived one.</p> <p>#### Impossible M<br> Nice concept but like the «&nbsp;Wireframe&nbsp;», the execution, from the patterns and stroke/fill color choices to the font and tracking, really sets it in trendyland with all its downsides: there are tons of logos and graphics like it right now as it’s one of the current best-seller to look «&nbsp;edgy&nbsp;», it doesn’t say much and it could be over 6 months from now.<br> All the derived material, like the WebMaker, MozFest etc. symbols and catch phrase posters, are just that times 1000.</p> <p>#### Flik-Flak<br> Makes for cool illustrations and goodies but for a very complicated logo.<br> Like with the other routes, the derived symbols (MozFest, All Hands, Speaking Out etc.) look forced and superfluous.<br> It’s hard to decipher but it doesn’t lack in originality which is really what ties it to the concept behind it.<br> It has a slight dated look to it though and I am suspecting the color scheme.<br> It would be a shame to ditch it without some further rework though.</p>",

The passion from Mozillians in particular is coming through loud and clear. It’s awesome to witness—and exactly what an open design process should spark.</p><p>Some of the comments also suggest that many people have joined this initiative in progress and may not have enough context for why we are engaging in this work.</p><p>Since late 2014, we’ve periodically been fielding a global survey to understand how well Internet users recognize and perceive Mozilla and Firefox. The data has shown that while we are known, we’re not understood.</p><ul><li>Less than 30% of people polled know we do anything other than make Firefox.</li><li>Many confuse Mozilla with our Firefox browser.</li><li>Firefox does not register any distinct attributes from our closest competitor, Chrome.</li></ul><p>We can address these challenges by strengthening our core with renewed focus on Firefox, prototyping the future with agile Internet of Things experiments and revolutionary platform innovation, and growing our influence by being clear about the Internet issues we stand for. All efforts now underway.</p><p>To support these efforts and help clarify what Mozilla stands for requires visual assets reinforcing our purpose and vision. Our current visual toolkit for Mozilla is limited to a rather generic wordmark and small color palette. And so naturally, we’ve all filled that void with our own interpretations of how the brand should look.</p><p>Our brand will always need to be expressed across a variety of communities, projects, programs, events, and more. But without a strong foundation of a few clearly identifiable Mozilla assets that connect all of our different experiences, we are at a loss. The current proliferation of competing visual expressions contribute to the confusion that Internet users have about us.</p><p>For us to be able to succeed at the work we need to do, we need others to join us. To get others to join us, we need to be easier to find, identify and understand. That’s the net impact we’re seeking from this work.</p><p><b>Doubling down on open. </b></p><p>The design concepts being shared now are initial directions that will continue to be refined and that may spark new derivations. It’s highly unusual for work at this phase of development to be shown publicly and for a forum to exist to provide feedback before things are baked. Since we’re Mozilla, we’re leaning into our open-source ethos of transparency and participation.</p><p><strong>It’s also important to remember that we’re showing entire design systems here, not just logos.</strong> We’re pressure-testing which of these design directions can be expanded to fit the brilliant variety of programs, projects, events, and more that encompass Mozilla.</p><p>If you haven’t had a chance to read <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/branding-in-a-new-land/ ?\">earlier blog posts</a> about the formation of the narrative territories, have a look. This design work is built from a foundation of strategic thinking about where Mozilla is headed over the next five years, the makeup of our target audience, and what issues we care about and want to amplify. All done with an extraordinary level of openness.</p><p>We’re learning from the comments, especially the constructive ones, and are grateful that people are taking the time to write them. We’ll continue to share work as it evolves. Thanks to everyone who has engaged so far, and here’s to keeping the conversation going.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Well, I have to say right away that I like none of the concepts, some are bad, others are worse. If I had to say something about each of them, it’d probably be this:</p> <p>The-Eye: I’m uncertain how the-Eye connects to anything that Mozilla does, in some of its incarnations if looks dangerously close to Opera’s “O”. As was already pointer out, is the All Seeing Eye a good logo for an Internet-oriented company at times when Internet privacy and security are one of the hottest topics? </p> <p>The Connector: I’ll admit that the logo looks fresh and lively, but the overall arrangement and color choice suggests something I’d expect to find on the doors of a kids toys store.</p> <p>Open-Button: The color choice is terrible and the overall feel is sort if “artificial”; it seems to be screaming “Hey, I was designed to be a logo of a company” at me. Also, am I the only one who finds it kind of… suggestive?</p> <p>Protocol: This one is the one I find the most tolerable. On the other hand it looks kind of uninspired and sterile.</p> <p>Wireframe world: I’m uncertain what to say about this one except that it just doesn’t work for me. I’m sorry that I can’t be more constructive about this one.</p> <p>The Impossible M: I consider this to be the worst one. The color palette evokes Pinball Dreams with incorrectly chosen video adapter. It also has the kind of 1980’s feel to it. It’d be cool if you were aiming for retro, but that’s not your goal here, right?</p> <p>Flik-Flak: I happen to kind of like this one. At least there is some originality to it. The full “Mozilla” tower is probably too big and complicated, but the simpler “Moz” is pretty fun. Plus it looks a bit like a stood-up cobra:)</p> <p>To put this in a bit of perspective, all of the fictional companies featured in the “Silicon Valley” TV series have much better artwork than anything I can find here and that is something that only needs to be shown for a few seconds on a screen every now and then. I’m sorry to everyone who worked on this but unfortunately that’s how I feel about it…</p>",

It also retains some of the original brand which makes the difference less jarring to those not accustomed to change. Blue and white feels soft and uneventful while red and white feels sharp and interesting.</p>",

      "content": "<p>After sitting with these for a little while, I think the 2 concepts that have the most potential are The Connector and The Impossible M. The Connector, because of its expansiveness and flexibility. The Impossible M, because of its strength as a cohesive mark.</p> <p>The Connector feels like it’s the building blocks for a whole visual language, and it gives me the sense of many different pieces working together. That feels like it has some nice parallels with Mozilla’s mission.</p> <p>The Impossible M, visually, feels like it has a ton of unrealized potential that needs to be explored. I could see a lot of different takes on the colors and shapes that make up the M, even potentially breaking those shapes apart in a way that brings the visual style a bit closer to The Connector. For a single indelible mark, The-Eye, Protocol, and The Impossible M are the best candidates. The-Eye is too creepy for me, and Protocol feels stuck in the past and tied to a bit of internet arcana that –&nbsp;while clever and recognizable to many people –&nbsp;seems limiting.</p> <p>Both The Connector and The Impossible M could benefit from a lot of refinement (which I know is coming). The most glaring execution issues, to me, pertain to the wordmark that goes with each one. The word “Mozilla” needs to not feel stuck-on or like an afterthought, but like an integral component. Some low-hanging fruit as far as bringing the wordmark in line with the logo mark: for The Connector, using a typeface that picks up on the roundedness of the other shapes. For both, using a typeface whose ‘M’ slants outward on the sides – even if not in as extreme a way as the ‘M’ shapes do in both logos – rather than an ‘M’ with straight-up-and-down side strokes.</p> <p>A last word on The Impossible M: I get that part of its ‘backstory’ comes from vibrance, creativity and diversity, which are all great things to connote. But I think it’s a bit hamstrung by its retro vibe. In an age when we no longer need to be so concerned about viability for printing processes (color separations, moiré dot patterns), the dots feel like an unneeded throwback. I would encourage everyone (especially the designers!) to look beyond this specific visual style, and judge the concept based on the underlying shape of the mark.</p> <p>Just my 2 cents. (OK, maybe that was more like 20 cents.)</p>",

To be clear, that is almost already the case. Cf. the new curl logo: .</p> <p>I have been a long-time user of Firefox (been using it almost continuously since I first started using the Web really). In recent years, my confidence has been shaken by various choices that Mozilla has made (each of which seemed to be taken because Mozilla had forgotten its purpose). All of the designs above do nothing but underscore that aimlessness that shook my confidence in the first place.</p> <p>If given the choice, I would scratch the rebrand effort wholesale until Mozilla has figured out what direction it should be headed in, and then a rebrand can be used to emphasize the new mission statement.</p> <p>For the sake of completeness, I would like to include what I think Mozilla’s renewed mission should be:</p> <p>1. Freedom (or, perhaps Liberty depending on how rigidly you separate the two concepts)<br> 2. Diversity (or, perhaps Inclusivity or Openness; consisting of people of many different backgrounds means nothing unless everyone is welcome)<br> 3. Community (yes, this is separate from 2. Mozilla has always thrived because of the community that surrounded it; from its contributors and from those who believed in its goal)</p> <p>In thinking about the above goals, the attached images are the thought-process I went through arriving at what I feel could be a decent concept (note: I am rather obviously not a graphic designer; but they’re meant to be concepts, not finished designs).</p> <p>At first, I immediately thought of a Venn Diagram between Liberty and Diversity where the overlapping center would be Mozilla.</p> <p>While simple, I do not believe it adequately captured Openness as a guiding principle. So, I dropped the old Meta-Bold “m” and opened the bottom of the Venn Diagram (leaving an “M” in the overall shape).</p> <p>Progress, but I still think that Community is an important part of Mozilla and should be reflected here. So I wanted to add some bounding to the concept. At first, I thought of parenthesis which could look/feel like arms enveloping the “M”. But, with the Venn being a part of the logo, parentheses seemed to just add line noise. Another large part of what makes Mozilla (or, what I believe should make Mozilla, anyway) is the web. And, in accordance with the RFC for URIs, there are only two things which you should use to surround a URL: whitespace and .  seemed perfect. For the sake of style, I opted for ⟨⟩ rather than  only because Linux Libertine has rather beautiful glyphs for them and they meld in well.</p> <p>I should also mention that, if there were to be a fourth Guiding Principle I think Mozilla should endorse, it would be Revolution, and I do not believe the concept I offer here does anything to evoke the revolutionary spark that I would like to see.</p> <p>While these designs are offered freely and without restriction (consider them Public Domain or CC0), I would prefer Mozilla did not use them without first seriously reevaluating its goals and mission.</p>",

It has an “against the grain” look going for it, which I think speaks to the brand, but it would still fit in any context. It reminds me of a logo you’d see on a cool tech magazine. The more I look at it, the more I like it.</p> <p>The protocol design immediately makes me think of the Internet… like “this company makes the Internet”. It’s simple. I don’t think anyone would have trouble understanding it, and it says something specific immediately. It does not, however, say anything else about the brand. It’s very impersonal seeming.</p> <p>The other designs are too abstract or too generic. I hate the “open” logo. It just looks like a generic and meaningless icon. The “connector” logo is okay, but too abstract to read. The Flik-Flak logo is ridiculously abstract, will be unusable in black and white, and is too vertical to fit in common logo locations. The impossible M is bland, but maybe with some work could be better. The wireframe design makes me think of King… which is fine I guess, but it also doesn’t really tell me anything about the Mozilla brand.</p> <p>My top choice is the lizard eye design, but like so many others, I wonder if it might make sense to do another round of designs from scratch.

I’d honestly get behind something like that.  </p> <p>For these, I’d say the lizard (The-eye) eye is (A) Not really evocational of a lizard eye (more of a cat eye), (B) too evocative of Sauron of LOTR (And thus being spied on), and (C) Horribly 1970’s in color scheme.</p> <p>The abstract tribal Mozilla is too busy and too colorful.  There’s a reason why most companies don’t have more than 3 colors in a logo (seriously, go look at all the big companies, you won’t find many that use 6 colors in a logo).</p> <p>The on button looks too generic, there’s too many items that have an on button.  You’re losing your branding with that one, and you may have issues with keeping it as ‘your logo’ if someone copies it due it being so generic.</p> <p>The wire frame logo would be decent if you were, say, a 3-D printer company, but as it is, it’s too monotone (the opposite of the tribal issue).</p> <p>The abstract unfolding Mozilla has too many colors, and too many facets.  I like how the Mozilla is hidden in the design, but you’ll also need that logo to work in monochrome, and I don’t think it will.  </p> <p>The impossible M is too simpllistic, and looks like it was done in Microsoft Paint.  It would be ok for a smart phone icon, but not a company logo.  Plus the color scheme screams ‘blah’.</p> <p>Finally that leaves us with the Moz;//a, which is the best of a bad lot.  It’s cute and geeky, but it’s also going to be confusing to people like my mother who’s 75, and actually computer literate (more so than a lot of people younger than her).  If it confuses her, it’s going to absolutely brain stump the average user ‘I use the internet for e-mail and adult entertainment’ crowd.

I felt that the word itself needed a strong, but approachable type so I used a condensed version of Myriad Pro. Finally, the bold RGB red used to color the old dino head seemed like the perfect touch to at once 1) confirm the connection to the brand’s visual legacy, 2) add a pop of color and energy to visually symbolize the trailblazing nature that has always defined Mozilla, and 3) to maintain a connection to the web, by using the classic RGB red.</p> <p>Let me know what you think.<br> Olivier</p> <div class=\"comment-image-box\"> <p class=\"comment-image-reloaded\"><a class=\"cir-image-link image-id-244\" href=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/mozilla-logo.png\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"410\" src=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/mozilla-logo-500x410.png\" class=\"attachment-baseline-mini-grid-thumb size-baseline-mini-grid-thumb\" alt=\"mozilla-logo\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 600px, (max-width: 1000px) 160px, 300px\"></a></p> </div>",

      "content": "<p>1. Eye – I like the readable but stylish letter outlines, and the contrasting whitespace. However, the-Eye first reminded me of the-Eye of Sauron. Only after a few moments did I realize that it was referencing the Mozilla red dinosaur. I like the reference in that context, but I think most people will not know the history of the logo, and the logo will make them think of something evil always watching, like I first did. I like the colors, but having multiple eyeballs in sub-logos just looks weird. Free-floating eyeballs are gross.</p> <p>2. Connectors – I found it hard to notice the letters in the square form. It looked at first like a nice-looking but simple “M” on top of some unnecessary random lines. I like the written-out word version more, especially the creative but legible layout of the letters “MoZi”. I find it harder than it should be to interpret the final caret shape as an “A”. I would enjoy the logo more if the “A” at the end were more interesting, by having a big form with interesting interlocking like the first few letters do.</p> <p>3. Open-Button – The elevator Open-Button look is fine. I was actually kind of disappointed to notice that the logo could be seen as a face as well, because that makes it look more generic – more like a ripoff of LG’s logo. Anyway, I think the bright blue and magenta colors are too garish. Black with magenta would look nicer, if you want to keep magenta because of its resemblance to a mouth’s skin tone. Or perhaps you can make some other pun on an elevator open door that references the web, e.g. a globe or an ethernet port, rather than looking like a person.</p> <p>4. Protocol – I don’t like the protocol look. Even after knowing that the “://” is supposed to mean “ill”, I have trouble reading the name as Mozilla – I keep on mentally sounding it out as Moz-a. Also, the M:// shorthand doesn’t make sense – it would translate to “Mill”, which has no relevant meaning. I also don’t like that the use of protocol syntax doesn’t make sense here – Mozilla isn’t a protocol or anything like it, it’s an organization. Finally, the alternating colors put confusing emphasis on “oz a”. If you want multiple colors, I would suggest having “Moz a” be the dark blue and “://” be the light blue.</p> <p>5. Wireframe World – My reaction is “meh”. I don’t like that the word “Mozilla” is small in this logo.</p> <p>6. Impossible M –&nbsp;It looks aesthetically pleasing enough, but it doesn’t feel especially relevant to Mozilla. The impossible shape isn’t clear enough to be an interesting visual puzzle – you have to look hard to even see that it’s an impossible 3D shape rather than a stylized 2D “M”. On the details page, I wish more of the proposed sub-logos used the dotted gradient, a critical feature of this logo that makes it look good. The current sub-logos have too many bright, flat colors without enough dark blue or white inside to give a break from the intensity.</p> <p>7. Flik-Flak – The first few times I saw it, it looked like an “M” shape on top of a pile of random junk. Now that I see the rest of Mozilla, it doesn’t look much better. The varied colors and the high contrast between the colors and greys make the whole thing look very cluttered. It might look better with either less-contrasty colors, or only two very contrasting colors. However, when I click through to the detail page, I like the look of the smaller and simpler “MOZ” version a lot more. I would prefer having that be the full logo, and not having a really tall “MOZILLA” version.</p>",

I love all of them in context of branding only, but by far it lacks a lot in technology aspect or maybe in reflecting Mozilla’s vision and mission. </p> <p>The-Eye, the moment I looked at it, it was too imposing. It has really strong presence, but it just doesn’t fit with Mozilla. And I’m sure, a lot of people will have said it looks like LOTR Sauron eye icon, so please stay away from it.</p> <p>The Connector feels like the previous London Olympic logo. At first I just can’t read whatever you are trying to convry through it, it just looks like a person is swimming to me. But after some time  looking at it, I understood it, but it could give people wrong impressions just like I did.</p> <p>Open-Button feels normal to me. It could work with less ornaments and thinner lines. But right now the brand just gave me an impressions that you guys are working in medical field.</p> <p>The Protocol is the one has the best concept among all. You might want to try Mozi//a. It has better composition right now it is too disturbing when I looked at it. One thing concern me is that it lacks personality of Mozilla.</p> <p>Wireframe has nice concept. Though I doubt 3D is the best approach for you guys. Maybe you want to try 2D looks and taking wireframe of your homepage of Mozilla and use it as your icon. And change the looks of the wireframe because right now it is too ‘classy’.</p> <p>Impossible M rubs a wrong impression to me. It has retro looks with half-tone patterns. You might want try another looks by deleting all the patterns and change the M with a bit of serif looks such as Garamond or Georgia. But for the future I would say please just stay away from this if you able to.</p> <p>Flik-Flak is really bad to me personally and my eyes are hurting. It looks overly complicated and it is like your first ever concept before designing everything else and you think it could work so decided to put it among the final concept list.</p> <p>Yeah that’s my opinion. Other seasoned designers might be better in giving opinion, but if I have to say something, those above is my opinion. I would love to see more of concepta because right now it is too early too decide. You could get something better in the future but you might not. Bear in mind that the branding will becomes the looks of your company for 5 – 10 years to the future like.you said and I feel like you really should lenghtened time schedule to decide everything.</p> <p>Please forgive me for any misspeling. Great work guys!</p>",

My feeling here is that all of these pieces are unrefined conceptually and aesthetically. They seem far from being representative of a professional and largely recognized organization. </p> <p>I believe it has to do with the fact that you are making designers do something that should take time at a “rocket-fast timeline”, forcing them to just crank out the first thing that comes to mind. </p> <p>Also, it is weird to me that on the first round suddenly we are seeing digital renditions of concepts, that might even try to pass off as a finished product, with examples of logo’s on  t shirts and such. I mean the logo’s even already animate. How is that a first round? How is this considered a consideration of a route when it seems all fixed? It seems completely counterproductive for the design firm to have put in so much work for animation and mock ups on so many concepts, when in the end one only gets one brand identity. Like 90% of the stuff here for show is guaranteed to be in the trash bin. That is the wrong allocation of time,. They should have not bothered with all the fancy show off stuff, and focused on the real deep conceptual place at this early stage.</p> <p>I would have thought an open design process would have started with conceptual directions and multiple sketches for each way of thinking. I don’t know who is deciding on how the process is to be open, but whether it’s open or not, the process used here to come up with a brand seems a bit whack.</p>",

The other logos were too reminiscent of the nerdiness that too often is associated with tech companies ( :// &lt;– puh-lease), and is a turn off (note: a symbol for on/off has the word \"off\" in it)… as in… \"put off\"… lends itself to jokes and ridicule from those of us who don't code for a living.

So they rebalanced the old, classy design and made it even better after that, and that is what they will use for years going forward.</p> <p>This one…. if you can maybe simplify it a bit more and make it so the logo adapts well to different countries I could see this being a winner.

This in itself kills it, but the-Eye of Sauron really drives home the forbidding feeling of it. Not a good idea.</p> <p>The Connector – Looks like an Olympics logo. Attempts to be trendy at the cost of readability, yet manages to remain unremarkable.</p> <p>Open-Button – A decent idea, but  the current iteration comes across as the kind of thing you would see on the side of a plastics manufacturing plant.</p> <p>Protocol – The best of the bunch at this phase. Not too complicated, and neatly references what the company is about. The font is perhaps  a notch too generic, but it doesn’t need much dolling up to reach a usable state.</p> <p>Wireframe World – An interesting concept, but ruined in it’s current state by an absolute lack of artistic balance. Both versions feel wonky in a very off-putting manner.</p> <p>The Impossible M – This one strongly resembles a VGA graphic from the mid 80’s. Imagery reminiscent of 30 year old technology is not what I would use to represent a modern company.</p> <p>Flik-Flak – This one also attempts to be trendy, this time at an extreme cost to readability. The-Eye does not flow naturally through the lettering, and gets caught in the angles and margins instead. It is an excellent example of how not to use a modern art style in a company logo.</p>",

But having looked at the full blog post, it just doesn’t portray the right feel for Mozilla, because it actually can look clumsy, and sometimes lazy, because all there is are a bunch of thick black lines, patterns and yellow.</p> <p>Protocol’s typographic treatment looks bland, predictable, the idea looks like it took a few minutes of doodling and not much thought went into it, especially the rendering, a commenter posted a mono spaced version here and that looks so much cooler. But this fact remains, the colon is forced to be an i, when it is in fact a colon. Let me make an example, what if I tell you this `i` is meant to be a colon? As in, My favorite colori red. Yes, it is the same thing, you may wishfully want it to be different, but a colon is not an i. Your company name is then Moz:lla. I’m using Moz:lla Firefox. And, oh you write code do you, oh so does Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Microsoft, everybody writes code, and there is no such thing as the M protocol, stop making shit up.</p> <p>The Connector is a mess, it is fussy, forced, too abstract, and if someone doesn’t know it’s supposed to be “Mozilla”, they can’t read that. The way the sub groups are done looks like a bunch of random lines thrown around.</p> <p>Wireframe world looks like you are a 90s company, and you’ve never had the budget to change your logo since.</p> <p>Impossible M should have been rejected before this stage, it doesn’t do anything and it’s ugly, it’s just an M that has been dicked around too much. If you are a designer and you shop this to a client, I think they might actually be cross with you.</p> <p>The Open-Button / smiley. Trying too hard to be fun, funny and losing sight of the larger picture. It’s ugly, complicated, too fussy, difficult to distinguish between them, and no one would care to. </p> <p>Flik-Flak, seeing the whole picture of the branding strategy, this feels a little bit like Google (before Alphabet), but it is incomprehensible, too abstract, too fussy and complicated. But this looks the best among all of them. But you should reject this as well for your own sake.</p> <p>No amount of random netizen feedback is going to give you the solid answer you need, because while people can tell you what they like and don’t, no one can generate the full brand vision you really need to proceed. And btw, your current logo is better than all of these combined.</p>",

Whether you add on or reduce the main logo in a particular context, the core metaphors of playfulness and adaptability  (i.e. tinkering, maker–spaces and experimentation) hold up.

As the iphone sinks, so will its themes. This is definitely a standout, forward looking, new-definition design language for the FUTURE, not the past.

But its genious lies in the fact that it brings the focus to what Mozilla does not and will never do: Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Yahoo and Apple all have to avoid associations of the ‘eye’ at all costs, because the collection and sale of user data are part of their business plan. This is also why they will shy away from Logos that make them appear too big and powerfull. But people use Firefox because you care about stuff like mass surveillance, after all “Mozilla is the proud non-profit champion of the Internet, helping to keep it healthy, open and accessible to all.” In a list with all those cutesy and harmless logos of the internet behemoths it will serve as a reminder what the others won’t tell you.

One note: the “M://” execution looks good, but would worry people unfamiliar with brand will read as “Mill”<br> Wireframe – Could grow on me.<br> Flik-Flak – The very basic “MOZ” part works pretty well. The unfolded “Mozilla” does not, IMHO – would be fun on an annual report maybe, but feels very busy for a mark.<br> The-Eye – its flaws are well-described in numerous other comments. Having said that, I actually like the ideas &amp; look in many ways, just not for this application. It is kind of cute – reminds me of Monsters, Inc. – I could see the germ of this idea, with some different execution, being a strong candidate.<br> Open-Button is not bad, but feels like the submissions one gets on (e.g.) 99 Designs, when designers will just throw some stock work against the wall. While the circular mark is interesting enough and can be adapted in different ways, it could be stuck on to almost any other brand just as easily – nothing unique about it.<br> Connector – Cute, colors fine. Reminds me of the poorly-received London 2012 Olympics logo. Also the clever alternate configs are probably not terribly practical/useful as you’ll end up with more chance of conflicts with existing marks the more permutations you play with).<br> Impossible M – I know there is no accounting for taste, so I’ll just say I find it remarkably unpleasant. I understand some people thinking it would look great on a t-shirt, I could see that. Most other applications? I am less sure. The alternate executions are largely quite weak as well.</p>",

The-Eye belongs to Pixar. The Connector is a deconstructed subway map. Open-Button is a power button.  Protocol is a URL (the most relevant of all of them, but still coat-tailing at best).  The Impossible M comes from Escher. The two whose origins are not obvious to me (Wireframe, Flik-Flak) are both too complex and too clever.</p> <p>The most successful brands are the simple ones: McDonald’s Golden Arches, Volkswagon’s badge, Amazon’s smile. A good brand is not a brain teaser. It isn’t showing off how clever you are. It is easy to draw, easy to recognize and easy to defend as a trademark.</p> <p>Even the old Netscape “dawn of N” was too complicated and too generic at the same time.</p> <p>My recommendations:</p> <p>Stop trying to say something with your brand other than “Mozilla”. For that matter, “Mozilla” is already your brand. Just develop that. Maybe, _maybe_, consider shortening it and stylizing the M or the Z, but if you do, be careful not to tread too close to Zillo.</p> <p>Consider the color-blind and the cost of printing color vs monotone. If your brand depends on color it will fail.</p> <p>Avoid references to other things (eye of Sauron, power button, Escher). It risks confusion and makes the trademark harder to defend.</p> <p>Your brand should not require explanation.</p> <p>Your brand should be timeless. “Retro” is not good.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I’m usually cautious when it comes to giving design feedback w/o any background information, as feedback should always come w/ understanding of the concept. This is especially true for branding. However, since these are being presented as is, here are some of my opinions.</p> <p>1) The-Eye.<br> As many have pointed out, there are various associations w/ the-Eye. The way it’s depicted, it’s usually associated with something monstrous. When paired with the font, it becomes a bit more childish. So I see the design is more suited for a children’s publishing company, that creates interactive experiences for kids.</p> <p>2) The connector.<br> This by far seems the most flexible system. The square variation is difficult to read, but that is fixed by the 2nd form that spreads the letter forms out. The ability to create patterns, and changing colors adds to the flexibility. The style doesn’t tie it to any particular era, or industry. The country variations becomes interesting, and can allow the brand to speak to region specific consumers.</p> <p>3) Open-Button.<br> There is probably a story behind the shapes chosen for the button, but it’s a bit difficult to understand as is. The attempt to create a character’s face out of the motif seems slightly force, but it can be fun. However, the trend of creating specific characters as representations have sort of faded in the past couple of years, and seems to mostly relegates itself to the telecommunication companies. So the design can become dated quickly, and may not be industry aligned.</p> <p>4) Protocol.<br> The :// is conceptually relevant, and easily understood for people who are familiar with the internet, or computer languages. However, the type choice, font weight, and the coloring all scream 90’s big corporate tech company, like Microsoft and IBM. It distances itself from the casual consumer. It can make a suitable logo if “corporate” is the concept. The M:// motif also comes of as authoritarian, as if Mozilla is giving off commands. While the text in black is kerned way too tightly.</p> <p>5) Wireframe.<br> Wireframes have been used a lot in recent years for tech business, especially for social media related ones. Some can be seen as variations of an overall branding language, like Medium’s new branding. So there’s a sense of familiarity. However, “draping” the wireframes with flags seems to be a disconnect with a concept that is not really apparent. Condensed fonts also oscillate between on trend and being dated.</p> <p>6) Impossible M.<br> This is playing heavily on nostalgia by harkening back to the 90’s MTV era, which doesn’t necessarily fit a company that is trying to be a leader in technology. While that trend is making a come back recently, like all fads, it can fade quickly. The brand also doesn’t seem to match the audience it’s trying to appeal to, nor does it really seem to match the identity of Mozilla, unless there’s a major business shift.</p> <p>7) Flik-Flak.<br> This is very reminiscent of branding for art schools from the 2000’s. It is difficult to understand its connection to mozilla’s brand. It is also a bit difficult to read. Not necessarily on trend, doesn’t seem to be on brand, and not really innovative.</p> <p>In general, majority of the logos seem more on trend than on brand. 2, 3 and 4 seem workable if more refinement is put in.  The connector seems to be the most flexible system. Understanding the brand story for each might make one stand out a lot more than the others.</p>",

Google manages to to this by having absolutely crystal clear typography but the square arrangement is just not clear enough and the horizontal version exposes how the lettering is WAY too stylised to be clear. </p> <p>The multi colour also feels like a bit of a copy of Google’s brand so you have to be very careful that Mozilla’s brand isn’t diluted by using something similar. </p> <p>If you look around at wordmarks they are lead by typography. Think of Disney, NASA, Coca Cola, FedEx, Ebay, Subway, Visa, Facebook, Ubuntu, Panasonic, CNN, Kellogs, Canon etc etc. The list is endless but they’re all lead by typography and the colour scheme is supporting act. I’d say FAR more effort needs to be put into the typography of this design if it is to be successful. </p> <p>On a positive note there is absolutely MASSIVE potential here. It’s a modern, striking idea that speaks to the core values of Mozilla. It’s actually quite exciting to think of how good this design could be. It’s far more impactful, deep and subtle than the blunt simplicity of the ‘zilla eye’ or the inward geek naval gazing of the m:// design. And the others don’t bare mention as they’re not even contenders. </p> <p>Done correctly the square letter arrangement has the potential to become very iconic (in the true sense of the word).

      "content": "<p>I read about a third of all these comments here, but now I’m just going to give my opinion without reading the rest. That’s just too much.</p> <p>First of all: Never change a running system.<br> Is there a particular reason why you see the need for a rebranding?<br> This brings me immediately to the “Protocol”: It kind of resembles the old logo the most, while adding some new touch to it, even with a hint of what mozilla is and was about. Nevertheless it is not a complete start from the beginning. However, as some people already pointed out, it has the sad smiley face :/ in it. If you’d really go for this one, I suggest making it green instead of blue. Blue always represents a cold feeling, while green gives a relaxing vibe to the-eye.</p> <p>Now for the rest of the concepts. To be fair I don’t really like any of them that much, they always try to overdo stuff. Look at the logos of the most succesful entities on the IT market right now: Google changed from serif to non serif, to make it even simpler and easier to read. Same for Microsoft, the old stylized logo was exchanged for a new more lean looking one. The Apple logo went from Newton sitting under a tree to a simple one colored Apple and the term “Apple” with no additional styling to it. Other succesful things on the web, like reddit, tumblr or yahoo do the same, they reduce instead of adding to it. They are even written in lowercase, just like the current mozilla logo. And it’s successful that way..</p> <p>“The-Eye”. Well, nobody want’s the evil eye or Sauron watching him surf all the naughty websights, am I right? Also it looks like a vagina. A company for pussies? Excuse me, but it came to mind. I see no connection between the rest of the “The-Eye” logos to mozilla – in fact I see Ubuntu because of the coffee beans.</p> <p>“The Connector”. The slogan “Mozilla” beneath it is quite perfect. Simple, one colored, mozilla just written big now. Mozilla. The a is perfect in this one. The logo above it is having too much color and seems too wild. I see no connection between the logo and mozilla.</p> <p>“Open-Button”. This reminds me of goatse. Please do not pick this. And don’t search for goatse if you don’t know what it is, trust me on that one. Also blue and pink don’t really mix that well. I see no connection between this logo and mozilla. It kind of looks like a power button, not like a logo for a browser maker.</p> <p>“Protocol”. Make it green instead of blue and we can talk. I like the approach of having possibilities with the M://, e.g. M://Firefox Phone or M://Firefox. Maybe mix this one with the Connector one? Especially the a needs to be changed in this one. The connection between mozilla and this one is evident. Have you tried making one with round : and the a round circular o and a (the a which is also to be found in “The Connector”), so that the dots of the : can fit into the a and o? In german there is a saying “Das ist das A und O” (it kind of means, “That it important”). It would be quite fitting.</p> <p>“Wireframe world”. Is the web 3D? I don’t think so and I’ve seen a lot. So why wireframes? Also overdoing stuff for no reason. No connection to be seen with mozilla.</p> <p>“The Impossible M”. Looks like MTV or a construction companies logo. The impossible meh. It’s also not timeless.</p> <p>“Flik-Flak”. I like it, but it is way too much. There is a connection to be seen, but it takes quite a lot of time to recognize it.</p> <p>I hope you consider what I said, although I’m a bit late to the party here, I am a proud FF user for a very very long time now and I even call a firefox phone my own.<br> I’m sure you guys will figure it out, but don’t overdo something that hasn’t to be done at all!</p>",

      "content": "<p>Here are a few “big-picture” comments on the logo designs. My main crit is that many of these logos are a stark conceptual departure from your stated focus on “people,” because they emphasize the “techy” components of technology.</p> <p>Here’s why:  A focus on people implies an emphasis on what technology can help them achieve. It is an aspirational focus. People use technology only because it helps them to connect, to achieve, to succeed, to learn, to find meaning, to find community, and more.</p> <p>If you emphasize the mechanisms that underlie technology — protocols, scaffolding, power buttons, etc. — you are focusing on the minutiae of HOW technology works, as opposed to why people actually use it.</p> <p>Sure, some tech-geeks might be more intrigued by the mechanisms of technology rather than the emotional needs it can fulfill, but by focusing on that aspect of Mozilla, you’re limiting the image you portray to providing tools for the betterment of techies … not ALL PEOPLE, yes?</p> <p>But it’s a touchy balance … Mozilla is a foundation that is clearly immersed in technology, and ignoring it altogether could leave you with a generic image that could be just as relevant to a provider of, say, health care services.</p> <p>But I think you’ll do well to de-emphasize the tech in the design choices, even at the risk of being a tad generic. People will have a visceral response to whatever logo you choose; better to err on the side of warmth than technological coolness.</p> <p>That being said, my comments on the specific designs:</p> <p>1. The-Eye. Most people have an aversion to reptilian eyes; it’s probably imprinted on our DNA as our ancestors sought to avoid deadly run-ins with venomous reptiles, or being eaten alive by alligators and crocodiles.</p> <p>Plus, most people associate reptiles with cold-bloodedness or just “coldness” — an unattractive property. Think of a soft bunny. Now think of a monitor lizard. In your mind you are drawn to one, and are compelled to avoid the other. Reptiles don’t make you scream “warm and fuzzy” — they just make you scream.</p> <p>The-Eye = No.</p> <p>2. The Connector. Ahhh … this is my favorite. It provides a very distinctive connection between the symbology of tribalism — a people-centric concept — and circuit traces and program paths — the technology aspect. And “openness” is symbolized in the logo by non of the lines connecting to each other, and being able to reorganized in many different configurations.</p> <p>Finally, the fact that the logo very subtly spells Mozilla gives it one of the key characteristics of a good logo: ambiguity — and the “aha!” factor of discovery and delight.</p> <p>The connector = big yes from me.</p> <p>3. Open-Button. This logo emphasizes a mechanism of technology, as I mentioned in my big-picture comments above. Despite its ability to be reconfigured, it is still at its core a power button, and does not emphasize the concept of “peopleness.”</p> <p>The Open-Button = No.</p> <p>4. Protocol. Same comments as 3., above. Technology mechanism-based, and not people-based. Also, while the use of the “slash-dot” notation is clever, it does not have the same discovery and delight factor that, say, The Connector does. It’s just a tad _too_ obvious.</p> <p>Protocol = No.</p> <p>5. Wireframe world. This is kind of okay, but again, it emphasizes _structure_ over peopleness. The wireframe is evocative of openness, which is a good association, and also implies a technology aspect, but on balance, there isn’t much that is aspiration about this mark.</p> <p>Wireframe world = No.</p> <p>6. The Impossible M. Aside from the optical-illusion fun of the design, it looks more like a rejected MTV logo design from the ’80s, with its pop art-like Ben Day dots and Roy Lichtenstein colors. As art, it works, but it doesn’t really _say_ anything about Mozilla’s values.</p> <p>The Impossible M = A half-hearted No. The other half is Yes for whimsy.</p> <p>7. Flik-Flak. I kind of like the Transformers-like expansion, and the fact that it, too, spells Mozilla — although I thought the letters were a little harder to discern than those in The Connector. Points for symbolizing openness (reconfiguration), whimsy, and perhaps a nod to peopleness with its implication of something built by community. But negative points for complexity. I feel this mark would be difficult to decipher at smaller sizes, and hence comes across more as confusing than delightful.</p> <p>Flik-Flak = Another half-hearted No.</p> <p>Hope these comments help. Opinions are subjective, and YMMV! LOL.</p>",

It’s good to hear from you. </p> <p>When we entered into this open design process, we stated that we didn’t how it would proceed or turn out. To our knowledge, this kind of brand refresh has never been done at this scale before. We’ve learned in this phase of showing initial work that it can be challenging for people to assess. To some, it looks like final design. To others such as yourself, it looks like ideation spread thinly in too many directions.</p> <p>We need to show enough work to prove that a concept will extend across the many facets of Mozilla, but not go too far in refining the design in any one direction. There’s no rule book to follow in finding the right balance.</p> <p>You’re right in pinpointing that our timeline for this work is fast, and that the proof of concept is seven times what it would be for a single direction. We are also doing this in the open, which requires another level of communication not found in a typical brand assignment. It’s a Herculean task and one that johnson banks has taken on with good humor while producing inspiring work.</p> <p>These are initial, first-round concepts. Even though each direction is shown in an extended fashion to prove that it can work across a variety of programs, communities, and products, refinement in the designs are still to come. When the story of this open design process is written, we’re hopeful that the design community will benefit from this experiment as much as Mozilla will.</p> <p>Thanks again for joining us for this review. Please stay tuned and continue to give us your feedback.</p>",

Otherwise, it needs more substance. Maybe a bit of three-dimensionality in certain design elements, and a less confusing frontpage.<br> Protocol (9/10) is simple which is good, however the font choice is pretty bad, the logo needs to have a more modern font.<br> Choose Open (8/10) seems like a good option, however it has a poor color choice. I would recommend refraining from “harsh” colors and combinations of such as they strain the eye, and I would also recommend to make the logo not curvy at the edges of it’s elements, that way it’ll look more modern and pleasing to the eye.<br> Wireframe (5/10) is not memorable at all, since it has no substance. You need to be careful with wireframe logos because it gives off an impression of a generic company, also the circles between the lines seem to be unnecessary.<br> The Impossible M (7/10) needs certain changes that will make it as modern as needed, for example, make the logo more flat and less based on outlines.<br> Flik-Flak (6/10) is bad, because it is diagonal, and a logo needs to fit for our displays and writing patterns, the small MZ version is more than enough. Either way, it’s too much like Cartoon Network so it needs colors that aren’t childish.<br> The-Eye (5/10) speaks surveillance too much, and just looks ridiculous, it’s a logo that feels too “fat” and “Opera”-esque. It has substance but it proves to be a copycat and invoke the incorrect feelings. Maybe change the colors or make it less “fat”.</p> <div class=\"comment-image-box\"> <p class=\"comment-image-reloaded\"><a class=\"cir-image-link image-id-268\" href=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/1997.jpg\"><img width=\"574\" height=\"410\" src=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/1997-574x410.jpg\" class=\"attachment-baseline-mini-grid-thumb size-baseline-mini-grid-thumb\" alt=\"1997\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 600px, (max-width: 1000px) 160px, 300px\"></a></p> </div>",

A harder, tighter edge to the font. And find an element to tie the font to the graphic image. I also think the colors should be slightly muted, a little less primary. Maybe look at funky colors from 80s and early 90s hiphop. Tone it down a little, but keep it bold and graphic.</p>",

I know lots of folks like it (they get it), but it leaves out those who don’t (and those who won’t) and the legibility/scannability suffers as a result. That may not seem like a big deal, but keep in mind that aside from Apple, we are largely going to be compared to other wordmarks.</p> <p>3) There is a boldness to this — in terms of its simplicity and its layout — that makes a statement that the others confusingly stumble on. We should have an opinion and be a presence. This should emit confidence, fearlessness, and determination. That’s our presence.</p> <p>Clearly, I don’t like the others (at all), for a variety of reasons. This is the only one that seems close. Caveat: I do believe that our current brand identity needs to evolve into this one, not recreate it wholesale. There’s nothing wrong with the dinosaur itself, nothing wrong with the red itself.

The colors are honestly painful.<br> – Text shows off the difficulty of kerning and weighting “Mozilla”.<br> – The icon itself is just confusing. Meaningless until the other examples show it to be a face, and then it looks emotionless and sad.</p> <p>Protocol:<br> – This seems to be getting positive opinions from folks, but to me it seems trite and a little amateurish.<br> – You’ll either get it, and raise your eyebrows at the bad pun making it into the logo of such a large organization, or you won’t get it and it just looks like a telco’s bad wordmark from 1994.</p> <p>Wireframe world:<br> – One of the better offerings, IMO.<br> – Visually strong, simple enough to use as a logo when it matters, works vertically and horizontally.<br> – Doesn’t try too hard to evoke very abstract concepts.</p> <p>Impossible M:<br> – I like the concept of the impossible M, like the abstractness.<br> – I hate the mid blue. It evokes unstyled HTML and bad Excel infographics. Mozilla has been around for a while; slightly more muted colors wouldn’t go amiss.<br> – Would like to see this explored more, particularly around width and the use of uprights instead of slants.<br> – Reminds me very much of Monogem’s logo, which I feel is very strong: <a href=\"http://www.monogem.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.monogem.com/</a></p> <p>Flik-Flak:<br> – The agency partner ran out of good ideas at 6, didn’t they?

Possibly my dislike of the colour scheme is overwhelming my other feelings :P</p> <p>Protocol:<br> My heart wants this one (with different typography) but I don’t think it speaks to a non-tech audience. Protocol is disappearing from the address bar in the browser, I don’t think many will understand this concept – but it sure does speak to me personally. </p> <p>Wireframe:<br> Would like to see more iterations on this concept. I don’t like the dot and line combo because it fades into  the background (lines are too thin?). I do like the privacy logo and the flags with the solid sides. This seems like a really flexible set of design tools, I’d like to see it refined.</p> <p>Impossible M:<br> The “M” says 80s TV production studio to me, I feel like I’ve seen it somewhere before.

It is very draft and should be developed.</p> <p>Regards</p> <div class=\"comment-image-box\"> <p class=\"comment-image-reloaded\"><a class=\"cir-image-link image-id-277\" href=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/m.jpg\"><img width=\"506\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/08/m.jpg\" class=\"attachment-baseline-mini-grid-thumb size-baseline-mini-grid-thumb\" alt=\"m\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/m.jpg 506w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/m-300x183.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/08/m-425x259.jpg 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 600px, (max-width: 1000px) 160px, 300px\"></a></p> </div>",

It silly to use colour just for visual effects. </p> <p>As much as you want to convey a message with your logo. A logo is not a conceptual art piece. Once the logo is installed, nobody is going to go read what you meant.</p> <p>Spelling the word “Mozilla” in your logo. You’ve said it yourself. You don’t have an icon, you do have a name.

Doesn’t scale down to a 16×16 tab icon at all, too abstract, color overload etc.<br> 3. Open-Button, Simple, but doesn’t obviously reflect the company from what I can see (is there an ‘M’ in there, or something else?). Maybe looks a little to much like a power on/off button icon.<br> 4. Probably the least polarizing of all of them, good simple neutral look. It’s kinda boring but not likely to result in excessive complaining. The minor geek reference is good.<br> 5. Unique, but again, probably doesn’t scale down very well. If this is used, the wire frame portions facing away from the viewer should be a lighter shade to make it less flat and jumbled.<br> 6. Another ‘generic’ option that isn’t going to cause major problems but also isn’t that interesting. I’d go with the :// icon before this one.<br> 7. Would look really cool unfolding itself in a gif animation but otherwise fails every practicality and versatility test a logo would normally be subjected to.</p> <p>I’d probably just go with the Moz://a option, or otherwise rework the zilla eye into some other forms and pick the one that looks the least like a surveillance company/Eye of Sauron.</p>",

A logo doesn’t need to be read as long as it’s recognized. While I feel like the vibe of this logo reeks of “Olympics”, if used properly within a well-conceptualized brand it could really create a unique and modern experience for us as users by being active and integrated throughout all products and applications, as opposed to just being a stamp or a character that lives in a little logo bubble.</p> <p>I believe it could use some attention on the color end of things. It works particularly well when it’s monochromatic, or has 2-3 colors (for example the yellow t-shirt design shown above). Structurally, it’s already very complex, and the complexity of a wide spectrum of colors does make it visually noisy as some people have pointed out already. Maybe it exists “color-less” unless called upon or animated?</p> <p>This one has my vote for the final choice.</p>",

The various rationales for each logo presented thus far, show Mozilla lacks a unified vision or understanding of the message that needs to be conveyed. This is reinforced by the number of people commenting on how each logo doesn’t “feel” like Mozilla. That core message, that core brand hasn’t been defined yet.</p> <p>To get on the right track, first examine the Vision for Mozilla and what it you do. You don’t have to do it here, but i would gather a team of people and answer the following questions:<br> ○ What do you want people to think and feel about Mozilla?<br> ○ How do you want people to interact with your company and products?<br> ○ What is Mozilla’s goal?<br> ○ What does Mozilla really do?<br> ○ What is Mozilla to the consumer?<br> ○ What is Mozilla compared to the competition?<br> ○ How should Mozilla make people feel?<br> ○ What aspects of Mozilla matter to your Ideal Customer?<br> ○ Who is the Ideal Customer/User for Mozilla?<br> ○ What aspects of Mozilla do you want to push/emphasis?<br> ○ What is the message?</p> <p>Take what you get from answering those questions and then narrow down that information over and over until you are left with a few words that encapsulate Mozilla. Do NOT try to be funny, clever, witty, smart, arrogant, demure, or lie when answering the above questions and refining them into a few words. Be honest and frank. </p> <p>The one to three words you come up with to describe Mozilla should be at the center of the brand. The brand then needs to be at the center of every decision Mozilla makes. If it doesn’t fit the brand it doesn’t fit Mozilla. </p> <p>From the brand, every logo/identity you then create should be a reflection of that core. The various takes on the core idea may be wildly different in the creative phase, but they should all be speaking to the same brand. </p> <p>Hope that helps.</p>",

However, people that know a bit about Mozilla and its fight for privacy can easily dismiss this idea. I think user “Jack” on this page had a neat idea to change the colors. It actually removes the “warning/danger/caution” connotation, and is more relaxing to look at.</p> <p>“The Connector”: kind of cool, but difficult to read. Good for people who like to think outside the box, but could be hard to identify for the average Joe. Although, I particularly like variations created by user Anthony Camp on this page (particularly the left ones with the neurons). Maybe that the key for this one is to not let the logo speak for itself, but to leave the name of Mozilla next to it.</p> <p>“Open-Button”: looks awfully similar to WampServer’s logo and colors. Hardly evokes anything close to Mozilla for me.</p> <p>“Protocol”: the play with :// is fun, and I think everyone can relate with it (understand the reference to <a href=\"http://\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://</a>), but overall this one looks very close to Facebook’s logo. Maybe change the typo and/or the colors? The blue on blue looks quite outdated for me.</p> <p>“Wireframe world”: don’t know how to say it, but it doesn’t work for me. I don’t like looking at it. Maybe because of the black and white? The difficulty to see the “M”? The too simple structure? Anyway, it doesn’t evoke something good or pleasant, for me.</p> <p>“The Impossible M”: overall, I think all of these logos look quite old and do not inspire “coolness” (something you could expect from a change of logo, and also something Mozilla needs). But this one takes the cake! Was it designed on Windows 3.1? I can imagine that it was deliberately designed to look old, but why? Also, I think it resembles one of the previous logos of another brand (can’t put my finger on it though).</p> <p>“Flik-Flak”: very hard to read for me (more than The Connector). Also, it would be more suitable for a parcel distribution company, IKEA or a company specialized in making and selling origami.</p> <p>To me, most of these logos look a bit outdated, to the exception of The-Eye, The Connector and Protocol. Was that something Mozilla wanted? If yes, then go for it! I can’t understand why, but I’m no marketing/advertisement expert. If Mozilla wanted something new, I would advise refining the-Eye, the Connector and Protocol designs, in terms of fonts and colors (and maybe some other tweaks).</p> <p>Anyway, I think this exercise is a really good idea from Mozilla, a good thing for the brand and for the community! I know that you only submitted these designs for comments, but you should also pay close attention to the designs made by other commentators, some of them are really cool.</p>",

Perhaps it resonates more with tech-geeks than with all people though.</p> <p>2nd place in my estimation goes to the Open-Button design, which I could see perhaps used as a wordmark with the Open-Button element in place of the ‘o’ in Mozilla for instance. It does feel a bit sterile however, like an insurance company logo – it’s a bit corporate.</p> <p>I agree wholeheartedly with comments I’ve seen that The-Eye as a design can have a negative connotation. Perhaps this could be softened somehow without losing the lizard eye effect – for instance I had a more positive response to the-Eye element used in the context of a monster face in the ‘keep the web wonderful’ t-shirt. Perhaps if this design incorporated more elements of a godzilla/monster face it would better represent the -zilla rather than a panopticon environment / all-seeing eye. The shape of the wordmark in this design is already shaped somewhat like the snout of a beast and perhaps this could be emphasized, teeth or nostrils added et cetera. The more I think about this design, the more I feel that it has the best potential for improvement and the boldest/most iconic colour scheme. </p> <p>I actively dislike the remaining designs. I feel strongly that they’re overly abstracted, cluttered, and complicated. Wireframe World looks like a fantastic landing page for a website, Flik-Flak looks awesome on a t-shirt, The Connector would be an on-fleek print on a pair of leggings, and the Impossible M looks music-festival-poster trendy. I’d hate to see any of them with the level of frequency that I see the Mozilla wordmark (this is the most friendly way I could think to word my reaction to these ones).</p> <p>Thanks for the chance to throw feedback at this, and good luck.</p>",

      "content": "<p>One very important consideration, which I hope the brand team are taking into account, is that the logo chosen doesn’t just represent Mozilla to the world, it’s also a brand for the community, in the way the Firefox logo isn’t. Which means that if a lot of Mozillians think “boy, that’s ugly” or “our logo is embarrassing”, it may have a significant negative effect on people’s willingness to identify as Mozillians. (And it means people will try their utmost to use alternative or older branding, thereby defeating the point. See what happened when they tried to ‘deprecate’ the dinosaur.) So my key hope for the new logo is not that it scores half a percentage point higher on some consumer acceptability metric, but that our community _like_ it and feel “yes, I’m happy having that represent me and what I do”. So my comments come from that perspective.</p> <p>* Route A: I like the-Eye, but I wonder if yellow and black is the right colour combo.<br> * Route B: far too clever for its own good.<br> * Route C: I don’t see how this is particularly a Mozilla logo, as opposed to any other company.<br> * Route D: I like this one the best. It’s clever, but still obvious what the word says. It’s got the right mix of geeky and approachable.<br> * Route E: I really didn’t see this as an M until the blurb explained it. Again, not seeing how this logo is particularly Mozilla rather than any other company.<br> * Route F: The idea of using various impossible/Escher designs as different logos is really interesting, but you’ve made it hard for it to be appealing by choosing some truly horrible colours :-| So it’s difficult to judge.<br> * Route G: well maybe, but I’m not convinced.</p> <p>Not sure if the colours are up for discussion – I hope so – but I’d prefer a red/black(/yellow/orange) logo like our previous one. Gives some visual continuity with the dino.</p>",

Tending more towards the developer market (using colours and font similar to other companies). So while it is safe and in the comfort zone of comparability perhaps to distinguish it better a different font could be used and variation on colour choice. Colours have quite strong reactions for people, especially those with headaches, (yellow for urgency &amp; pain, orange for warmth, red for passion, purple for prestige, blue for calm, turquoise for contemplation, green for nature &amp; particularly easy on the eye etc). The effect of colours on the eye is not gospel as many people have different visual capabilities (black&amp;blue vs. white&amp;gold dress is an interesting example).  So while the lizard eye was catchy at first and the rainbows and fluros of the other logos could be fun to glance at the_eyes quite often tend to strain in pain from staring at them or trying to read them. especially with mixed patterns which produce the optical blurs and scotoma normally related to such designs. This would be the one I would tend towards, however the Escher M was also a good reference.</p>",

While modernizing a brand in a Windows 10 world is unfortunately a ‘must do’, perhaps such a radical shift is not the best course of action (Windows 8 Start ring a bell?).  Maybe a more polished/updated current logo would be in order.  That way, it retains its familiarity with established users/contributors while still having the ability to draw new interest.  If I had any artistic ability, I could perhaps better show you what I mean, but sadly I do not.

Much like the others too many parts which are not cohesive makes it look more like a jumble whereas the MOZ variations both personalise the logo in a animal like shape (harking to the zilla) and they have a fun play on groups. Also there is an origami shape there. The abstract patterns in the backgrounds are a good tesselation and with variations in the colour scheme to perhaps more vivid ones can be more globally oriented.

In many ways the M also gets lost so it looks like a graph assignment identifying the node tree in pen etc. The ability to customise to a flag is a bit basic as a flag is already a sheet held up with a frame. So taking down a square of the primary colour/s and a square with the symbol does not connect back to the company logo as much.

      "content": "<p>My first impression is that I don’t prefer any of the concepts here to our existing wordmark, but I understand we need a stronger visual identity.</p> <p>The two I like the most are probably The Connector and Protocol, but here’s some feedback on each:</p> <p>The-Eye</p> <p>Black and yellow looks like hazard tape, the lizard eye is creepy and reminiscent of the-Eye of Sauron. The male T-shirt design shows how it could be softened to be a bit more friendly and fun looking, but as others have said it just looks like Monsters Inc. How would this be scaled down to a favicon? The-Eyeball on its own is just creepy.</p> <p>The Connector</p> <p>I like the tribal/circuitry direction of this. It’s very versatile and feels fresh. Again, I don’t think this would scale down well to favicon size,  the typeface of the accompanying text is boring and the visual design stretched out into individual letters on the baseball cap design isn’t very readable. I think the logo would actually work better in conjunction with the Meta Bold typeface of our existing wordmark, or the similar Fira Sans (bold) typeface we had made. I’d say overall this is my favourite design direction of the ones presented here.</p> <p>Open-Button</p> <p>First, I don’t like the colours. They’re too close to Flickr’s colours. Second, it took me a while to get that this was referencing lift (elevator) doors. My first impressions were of some kind of media controls, which would fit more with an audio/video related business. The animations are cute but don’t really make me think of the Internet. I much prefer the all-white logo on the t-shirt design, that actually looks pretty cool, but I’m not sure people will get it.</p> <p>Protocol</p> <p>This really appeals to my nerdy side and I think it’s quite clever. I think the wordmark works better in one colour for simplicty. I wonder how this will scale down to favicon size, that seems challenging. There’s not much graphical design going on here. My concern is that it might be too nerdy, and that for a lot of people it will just difficult to read.</p> <p>Wireframe World</p> <p>The animation is pretty cool but doesn’t seem very related to the actual logo design. I really dislike the wordmark with this. I think this design direction is a bit clunky and for me more associated with physics (molecules) than the Internet.</p> <p>The Impossible M</p> <p>I don’t like the graphics, the typography, or the colours. It’s very 80s/retro, but not in a good way.</p> <p>Flik-Flak</p> <p>I quite like the concept and the visuals of this, it makes me think of building in VR. I’m just not sure it works well as a logo. It takes up too much space and is a bit messy.</p> <p>Overall I’d say The Connector is my favourite as a design direction, but I don’t think we’re there yet.</p> <p>When we get branding right I think we do it really well. I loved the unleashed Fox designs for Firefox OS and I think our Firefox branding is very strong. At the moment I don’t feel like any of these concepts live up to that standard and actually I prefer our existing wordmark to all of these. I’d really like to see some other proposals before picking one of these concepts to refine. I’d be interested to see some proposals from visual designers inside Mozilla who know first hand what it feels like to be part of Mozilla.</p>",

Protocol for the more techie side of things, Connector for the community branding. The biggest advantage both of them have to me is that they both say “I represent Mozilla”. I look at them, and I get the same impressions and feelings that I get when I see Dino, the Firefox, or even the Thunderbird. That’s important to me, and that’s why I like those two the best.</p>",

Combine the pop art sensibilities (i.e. the moire or comic dots) of the “Impossible M” with the colors (though slightly more subdued – or less “regional feeling”) and design elements of “The Connector”, and then further combine it with the design system of “Wireframe” (though tweaked so it doesn’t look like other peoples stuff) which would then allow you to build all sorts of shapes for whatever needs promoting.</p> <p>The possibilities could be endless.

The colour scheme is a bit childish, and I would prefer to see it using more daring colours. Love the single coloured version though! You don’t need legibility to create a brand identity. It is easy however play too much on the lettering concept  and include it in every aspect of the branding. It would be nice to see examples of how it works together with stricter typography and imagery, especially for the web. This has the potential to be really great, in my opinion it just needs to be crisper, more precise, and possibly more obscure.</p>",

With alternate color palettes it can gain color- and youthfulness, while still looking great in monochrome as well. With all this versatility it can also transorm into fun and playful versions.

      "content": "<p>Hello, as someone who has majored in management and has a particular love for marketing I will provide my own take on this.</p> <p>First of all, before choosing, you have to consider two factors, obviously the aesthetic one, but just as important is the way the new logo will position the Mozilla brand, both by itself and in comparison to it’s major competitors.</p> <p>I will start with the “Good Fight” one. Well, I am not a fan of it from a design perspective, it’s just too “rough”. I think that in a browser market dominated by big corporations, Mozilla should try to project a friendly and approachable image to contrast the image of the big silicon valley mega-billion corp of competitors. </p> <p>This logo does not to this. It’s rough, bold and, so to say, attackive. Additionally, in a market dominated by privacy concerns regarding competitors like Google and Microsoft, I don’t think an eye in the logo sends the right message. Do not underestimate the subconscious effect that particular shapes can have. Eye is just connected in most people’s subconscious to concepts like surveillance, Orwell, tv shows et cetera. Even if you do recognise consciously that Mozilla has no relationship to these things, the subconscious effect is still there somewhere silently affecting your judgement.</p> <p>The Choose open option is also not one I would recommend, as it is simply difficult to get the intended message without having already been introduced to the thought process behind it. In contrast, at least for me it has that “boring and sterile” look that fits with a financial institution, risk management and insurance instead of technological innovation, openness and user friendliness. Case in point, the first thing it brought to my mind when I saw it was the Allianz logo. It’s simply too… bland and unclear.</p> <p>The With you from the start series suffer from the same problem of not transferring it’s message without prior knowledge of the thought process behind it’s design. Most people will just see it as a random, “geeky” logo. This perception is usually accompanied by a sense of complexity and technicality, which is not what you should be after for a mass market product intended for people with different backgrounds and computer use skills like a browser.</p> <p>The Impossible M one is simply, in my mind, devoid of a particular message, it is, so to say, empty. It does not transfer a message of either cunning innovation or user friendliness and familiarity. It looks uninspired and has no clear direction, which is a big red flag.</p> <p>On the other hand I am a big fan of both the Flik-Flak and the Internet of People. They both look friendly, exciting and inviting, which I think is what the Mozilla brand should position it self as to make a distinction from it’s competitors. </p> <p>Internet of People brings a sense of inclusiveness and openness, while also creating an image of creativity and excitement. Flik-Flak retains the values of being inviting and friendly but seems to also include a message of technology and innovation but succeeds in doing so in a way that seems friendly and not intimidating to the beholder.</p> <p>It’s hard to choose one of those two, as I believe both succeed in the basic principles but bring a different flavor with them. My only comes with Flik-Flak is that a 3D multi-dimensional logo might be tiring mentally if looked at too often and beware that it will not transfer well to physical devices or print if for any reason needed.</p> <p>For that, I have to cast my vote with the Connector one, it’s open, fun, friendly exciting and inviting. I think it is the one that will best represent the mozilla brand, and is easily the most distinct and memorable of the propositions. Closing, I would like to say that if you do finally choose the Connector logo, it could use with a bit refinement to be a bit easier to look at, mainly in paler colors and maybe a bit more curves instead of edges, so it becomes more eye and perception friendly. If you are reading this, thank you for your time.</p>",

The-Eye of Mozilla reminding us that we have no privacy on the internet makes for poor branding.<br> B: The Connector. This reminds me of the 2012 London Olympics logo. Fun design, looks great on gear but utterly incomprehensible.<br> C: The Open-Button. Simple, not dependent on the English language, quickly recognizable. It looks good on gear. The proposed derivative icons for things like Mozfest and the developer network could use some serious work but I think this is the one to go with.<br> D: Protocol. This one is simple and easily recognized . . . and far too geeky. People don’t type protocol:// in front of the address in the 21st century. You will be re-branding again sooner rather than later.<br> E: The Wireframe World. Whatever message it is trying to convey is not getting across. It’s just lines and dots. It too seems pretty geeky to me.<br> F: The Impossible M. I initially liked this one except for the colors but the more I look at it the more I realize why it makes me think of the 70’s. That design scheme would have been right at home on the PBS TV show The Electric Company. If you want that kind of groove, then go for it, man!<br> G: Flik-Flak. This one is my favorite. It is artsy. It reminds you that Firefox is the flagship product, and it looks good on the web site examples and apparel/gear. The simplified “Moz” version is as far as this particular metaphor should go. When you expand it out to the full Mozilla you have to really be looking for it to figure out that it is trying to spell out “Mozilla”.</p>",

Our ultimate design for Mozilla needs to help tell the entirety of the Mozilla story. Thanks for participating in this conversation.

Including other aspects of Mozilla, from policy and advocacy work to our community building efforts in parts of the world that are just coming online, and it can be an awesome challenge. I’m curious what you mean when you refer to Mozilla keeping our current logo, which today is a word mark. (The Shepherd Fairey- designed dinosaur was retired in external communications many years ago, and is only used internally and on the Mozilla Developer Network.) In a modern, connected world, is a word mark and a few colors a sufficient enough toolkit to communicate? In addition to helping communicate the totality of Mozilla, that’s why we’re engaged in this work. Thanks again for being a part of this.</p>",

Bold and clean.<br> Current problem is the high contrast giving me splotchy dark spots as if I’ve been starting at a bright light. That’s workable though.<br> The icon concepts below are decidedly less good. Do not like at all. If you go with this design, you have to drop the-Eyeball as mascot. Using a logotype is great, but that fat font needs to be taken down just a notch as the spacing is killing the readability.</p> <p>The Connector<br> I really like this design and I like the flexibility it offers in adapting it to different uses. Good potential here. Love the country flag treatments. Font is both boring and questionable. The dot over the “i” sits too close and kinda clumps into its base. </p> <p>Open-Button<br> I don’t like anything about this. Poor color choices, the emoji’s are both aggressive and difficult to decipher. Font is boring here too. Lowercase “o” has too much negative space compared to other characters.</p> <p>Protocol<br> I get it, I just think it’s dumb. I know these things are images, but wtf is up with the font here? The kerning is insane! They’re literally crunched together. I’ve actually opened this up on multiple browsers just to see if that was the problem, it’s not.</p> <p>Wireframe World<br> Has potential, even though not at the top of the list, I’d like to see it iterated on.</p> <p>The Impossible M<br> It’s okay, middle of the pack for me. Maybe it’s the dot pattern that doesn’t quite work, a gradient treatment within the bars or maybe a muted color underneath the pattern. As for the font, the “O” kills the “M” really makes it seems small and almost makes your eye ignore it entirely.</p> <p>Flik-Flak<br> My favorite of the bunch. Good font choice, the graphic can be used in many ways, would make for a great animated logo with collapsing boxes or folding out/upwards like an accordion. Offers so much design space beyond just the logo, it’s something you can really build on.</p> <p>Overall<br> Tier 1 – Flik-Flak, The Connector<br> Tier 2 – The-Eye, Wireframe World, Impossible M<br> Tier 3 – Protocol<br> Tier Delete – Open-Button</p>",

We established at the outset of this brand identity initiative that we could not be crowd-sourcing, voting, or asking for work from designers on spec. We believe that design is an expertise hard won from experience. While many people can provide their reactions to a particular design – and we welcome that feedback here – it’s more challenging for the average person to consider designs from a systemic perspective, for instance, or to know where a particular design might fit into a market of competing brand identities. In our experience, voting on logo design doesn’t yield the best outcome because most of us are averse to change at first, warm to it slowly, and embrace it only after it becomes familiar. These are first-round concepts designed to help us explore where to go next, so constructive comments and ideas are the most helpful at this phase of our work.

In this first round of initial concepts, we’re seeing which aspect of the Mozilla story we might want to lead with in words and visuals. Our agency partner johnson banks has done some preliminary studies of how some of these designs might animate or be influenced by the Web, and we’re confident that interaction and animation are possible for each. Given that we’ll be distilling these seven choices down to approximately three, we’ll likely save further work in that direction for a smaller subset of choices. Thanks for the reminder that most of this work will be seen on a screen and that motion will be a part of how the brand is expressed.</p>",

      "content": "<p>All of the options are problematic.<br> The monster/eye one at least winks (pun absolutely not intended) at Mozilla’s tradition, but before being reminded of this by the explanation, the immediate reactions I had was: “Big Brother Is Watching You”.  This is not mitigated by the more childlike monster-figures such as on one of the t-shirt mockups.  Needless to say this is the last thing Mozilla of all organizations should be associated with!<br> The connector concept is much less, well, alarming, but at the same time, like the monster, it doesn’t really convey what it sets out to convey. I look at it and see some non-threatening lines, which mean nothing to me – certainly nothing about connectivity. If you have to explain it, then it’s not working.<br> The Open-Button, likewise, does not convey openness. The two play triangles obscure the design heritage from the ON button being referenced, and beyond that – the fact is, it looks like a scary clown, of all things. I think an emphasis on openness, though, should be the central theme of anything you ultimately choose, if indeed you conclude that a logo should convey anything at all. This element is what separates Mozilla from literally every other major web and mail interface developer on the planet.<br> Lots of people seem to like the protocol theme. While I like the simplicity of it, and just being able to read the word ‘Mozilla’, the central pun is too obvious to the people who Mozilla already appeals to, who already know what it is and what its full suite of products are. They might find it cute, or they might find it dumb; I’m leaning towards the former. At the same time, it might not be obvious at all to those you’re trying to reach out to. The protocol prefix and :// are less ubiquitous today than in the past since today’s browsers – including Firefox – do not display it unless some protocol other than http is used (https or ftp for example), so I’d also find this design choice conceptually inconsistent: if the protocol matters so much, why omit displaying it in the address bar?  That said, it’s hard not to be drawn to the simple “M://” somehow (the :// replacing ‘ill’ in Mozilla on the other hand strikes me as a silly pun). I still think it would not be the correct choice, that conveying openness should be the top priority, but…I dunno. Maybe there’s potential here, too. Protocols of course are open specifications, so maybe this could in some way convey openness…but again, precisely to the people already in the know. The general populace just won’t get it.<br> The last three designs are all entirely too abstract and meaningless. They have no staying power. And they should not be in the running whatsoever.<br> All that said. I’m a bit puzzled. If the mission is to telegraph something about the organization behind Firefox, Thunderbird, Seamonkey (well not exactly that one but still) – well, what does the nonsense word ‘Mozilla’ really do for you, anyway? It only ever made any sense with the Fairey dinosaur. Having to make a logo that both makes the ‘Mozilla’ name distinctive *and* implies something about what that name should stand for when there is nothing inherent to point to that meaning in the word ‘Mozilla’ itself – at least, outside of the tech community – well, that seems to me like a tall order. I’m not saying the name Mozilla should be dropped, necessarily, but that it doesn’t look like you guys were clear-eyed about what the task to be done here is were you to stick with it whilst having goals other than mere distinction, and have bitten off more than you can chew. If you guys *did* realize this, really – well, I don’t think you ever would have approved most of these designs, even in a preliminary manner.<br> Personally, I think that making Mozilla distinct might be a more achievable goal – in this I agree with commenter Robert de Forest’s analysis above – rather than trying to do both that *and* shoehorn meaning into the word ‘Mozilla’. Updating the Fairey dinosaur, *maybe* in a way that pays homage to NCSA Mosaic and Godzilla, should probably be your starting point if you chose to do this. As for making the public more aware of the fact that Mozilla is more than just Firefox: once again this is a tall order for a logo, and there are more obvious places to start. Any information about any product other than Firefox is completely buried at mozilla.org. There is no obvious way to simply get to the download page for Thunderbird, for example – I kept having to Google it.<br> I’m sure that none of this is what you want to hear, and I promise that I’m not trying to be negative for the sake of being negative. I care a lot about this organization, and was one of the original contributors to the NYT ad campaign ahead of the Firefox 1.0 release, and think Mozilla would be very poorly served with _any_ of the options put forward in this blogpost, as they are right now.</p>",

I feel like the contrast of the darker blue with Firefox’s orange would really make it pop, and give it a more playful, and youthful appearance.

Might want to consider why a rebranding is even necessary? I don’t think most companies with a recognizable logo need to rebrand at all. Seems like a waste of time and money. What does the research really say about the lasting impact of a rebrand vs the cost of the design and roll out? (let’s find real research on this). My own company (a social-service nonprofit) just paid a forture to rebrand and ended up with the most generically useless logo that replaced a nearly 100 year old highly recognizable one. Might have been better to have an update on the old logo rather than scrap it. Might not apply here, due to the young age of Mozilla, but the point is that what’s wrong with the old text?</p>",

In the ‘About Mozilla Open Design’ page you mention “being transparent is what we do”, “inviting others to participate in making a better Internet”, and “work together to prove that the Internet can be a place of empowerment, opportunity, and choice for all”, The Connector identity design relates to the points mentioned.</p> <p>The negative space around the logo itself resembles being transparent as there are no boundaries or a frame. Due to this it’s also inviting and the 90 degree angles in the shapes used give a sense of invitation as they are almost hugging each other. </p> <p>How the identity has been applied to work for or in different countries is also very effective. It adds a personal connection and clearly makes the identity of Mozilla versatile. This connects to ‘working together’.  </p> <p>The identity could also be active, it could have motion where the shapes move about in Tetris form and create the Mozilla logo or the national versions of the identity.<br> As for the colour scheme the logo version is eye catching and is appropriate because of the fact Mozilla likes to work with people. I would however change the black used on the name to one of the colours used in the shapes because the black itself is too strong and doesn’t seem to be a part of the whole design. The national versions work out great as the colour used in text matches the colours used in the shapes. </p> <p>Hopefully my feedback helps in anyway. By the way awesome idea of inviting the public for their feedback on building and developing you brand identity. Great experience. </p> <p>Thanks Arun</p>",

It has to be legible, recognizable, transparent, working on every background/surface, and even varying its form (just as the Flik-Flak example, although it has nothing identical with it).

That brand has a positioning, a proposition and a personality – to express that brand through the identity the designers need to understand the brand in depth. The public don’t have that depth of understanding and aren’t experienced in judging how well an identity captures the brand (indeed clients often find it hard).  Sure, research the final shortlist of identities with key stakeholders to check for negatives but choosing a brand identity is not like choosing a piece of art or home furnishings or clothes.  Johnson Banks is a very good firm who have created some great identities; I very much doubt the final design will represent the brand better because the people have chosen.</p>",

The flexibility of the icon is great, it’s got a slight retro feel, and can be evolved to stand through a long period of time.</p> <p>I’m not 100% sold on the colours, I find them too primary and unrefined.

You cannot argue about uniqueness in context speaking about how the pictogram is a metaphor of freedom when standing alone it cannot communicate the subject at all. I find it to be a very enthusiastic thought to visualize freedom of choice. Even more so when after looking at it again and again it looks actually more closed than open, the highlighted part being some sort of gate or door. If you’re about to merchandise it like it’s showcased here the logo got to speak for itself. You cannot just throw something into peoples heads and “hope” that it works. This would need gradual disconnection from the logo type over quite some time in my opinion.<br> The color choice feels poor and not really thought about (Is blue open because it is the color of the sky? Why is the accented part pink then? Is it the wonder of freedom?). People might think colors are only personal choice but in fact there’s a whole lot more to them.</p>",

As it is, it can be 50 years or more from now.</p> <p>Furthermore even for a first concept a lot of the showcased approaches lack thought if it wasn’t for the contextual explanation. Almost none of these logos could stand for themselves without being accompanied by the additional word mark. There’s interesting ideas about the metaphor, but the logo is a visual representation of your work. If you’re a carpenter that could be a hammer, if you’re a painter that could be a brush. You think this sounds old, simple minded and ugly? Well just draw a nice one weight stroke brush logo with a hipster touch to it and it will be awesome but only for a few years of hype.</p> <p>That said “the connector” and the “Flik-Flak” are strong visual concepts (not new in any way) with huge flexible potential but just as much can it be a complete fail if not executed by a very capable graphic designer who does a lot of pattern design.</p> <p>I don’t quite understand why you wouldn’t approach the online design communities with this (well don’t know if you did but to be honest the results don’t seem like it) I bet there’s quite a few of top notch designers out there who would love to gift some of their work time to this open source project (there’s a lot who wouldn’t as well). Hell there’s even people doing redesigns for projects that didn’t even ask for it, and some of them do them quite well.</p> <p>Sooo…if I had to vote I’d vote for…none. Keep the word mark and get marketing…Maybe find a very simple logo for the mother of the fox(!) to accompany the word mark. That would relate and make sense. But I guess it’s a bit late for that.</p> <p>Good luck! I hope you don’t release something without proper consultation from experts. Sounds elitist? I don’t care!

      "content": "<p>– “The-Eye” uses the same two colors already present in that often-used Javascript logo, and the-Eyes look kind of creepy, although I can understand how it’s a visual pun on (Mo)zilla and reptiles.</p> <p>– “Open-Button” uses two colors that are hard to make work together in my opinion, and that makes it even harder to integrate visually. Also those two colors together have a cultural significance that’d make me think it’s more about dealing with gender issues than technology.</p> <p>– “The connector” is nice, it’s clever, it doesn’t have any other visual meaning like “The-Eye” , it’s colorful and doesn’t have a boring shape, but conversely that makes it hard to memorize as a whole.</p> <p>– “Protocol” is simple, one of the most readable, can be typed easily (Moz://a, bam) which can make it really efficient for communication over websites such as twitter. It’s also easy to remember. While not everyone will get what it means, it will certainly please technology-inclined people, who are those who do proselytism.</p> <p>– I find “Wireframe World” rather bland despite its rather complex and uneven shape. Many people nowadays uses this kind of picture when they want to quickly represent the internet or social networks, it doesn’t say anything about Mozilla. This may as well be some random silicon valley start-up’s logo.</p> <p>– “The Impossible M” has kind of a retro look and rather strong colors, but using an impossible shape is something rather common, and when flattened it just becomes a large M, thus losing all specificity. Moreover, I think its icons look like they’re from Win98, but hey, who knows, maybe design trends will get back there soon :)</p> <p>– “The Flik-Flak” is interesting: a few colors easily associated to firefox’s and geometrical shapes that still create a whole coherent shape, with many possible variations, from complex to simple.</p> <p>Now if I were to rank my preferences:<br>  1° The Protocol and The Flik-Flak: both are original enough (hey, it’s hard to come up with something), look modern enough, don’t have colors that may be hard to integrate in another context, and can as simple or as complex as needed.<br> 2° The Connector: like the two previous ones, but it doesn’t have an easily memorized global shape other than being a colored square, although I recognize it’s clever.<br> 3° The Impossible M: despite what I said, it’s still recognizable enough, but might be hard to simplify into small icons.<br> 4° Wireframe World: cookie-cutter logo.<br> 5° The-Eye and Open-Button: the weird territory. They both bear too much meaning that have nothing to do with mozilla, namely surveillance and gender issues (no, really, I could totally see the Open-Button used by a radical sectarian masculinist group who’d use the blue color to mean how men should dominate that tiny pink stuff at the bottom; I may be over-interpreting, but I can’t shake off how weird it looks).</p>",

But what is the price of these two merits?<br> A) Even if the :// proves to work in the future of the internet, this only feels applicable with Mozilla being “that company that makes Firefox”. Protocol has no variants for Mozfest, or Maker Party, or Open systems, or even national branches; it just has tacked on emoji. This is symptomatic of the greater problem that Protocol has no versatility.</p> <p>B) The design language of clean, minimal text with non-threatening colors is marketing convention at its finest. The problem with that is it gives the impression of Mozilla being conventional and corporate. Sure, acting professional is a reasonable thing, but Mozilla isn’t about being another tech company. To me Mozilla stands as a guardian of what the internet was meant to be, and a symbol of how non-profits can impact our everyday lives. Also, anything that reminds me of HP Enterprise’s non-logo is a black mark in my book.</p> <p>C) It’s BORING, I’m looking at the shirt samples and the first thing I think is, “I cannot imagine people actually wanting to buy this”. Even entrenched brands from Pepsi to Microsoft have some degree of visual pizazz in their marketing.</p>",

As an open-source organization, Mozilla believes that transparency and participation prevail over decisions being made out of public view, even decisions made by us.

We’re learning as we go how to strike the right balance between the voices of our audience and the expertise we have in house at Mozilla and in our brand agency partner johnson banks.

While the work you’re viewing has not been generated by our community, it has been informed by comments made on earlier posts about what story Mozilla wants to lead with as it reintroduces itself to the world. Our final design selection will be the wrapper for Mozilla stories about the people, technology and products that are making the future Internet. It’s the final step in a process that has included business strategy, market analysis, consumer research, positioning, and brand personality. Thanks again for being a part of this conversation.</p>",

I personally have had situations getting out of control because I had the first meetings with more than one or two responsible persons/clients even more so when my concepts weren’t absolutely strong and I myself convinced of them which makes things easier to sell/present. And here is you (the client) asking a broad public for their opinion on a variety of first ideas.<br> Others as well said it: Very brave move to publish this. I hope you don’t get confused in the process.</p> <p>Still so, the first concepts don’t relate in my opinion. Sebastian mentioned the dinosaur which I already had forgotten. That could be history to work on. Also I’ll repeat myself saying that you shouldn’t just trash your very polished word mark with the lowercase “m”. Lots of big firms don’t need logos. Just their name. It’s their brand mark.</p> <p>I’d say to Johnson Banks: “Keep it simple!”. You’re trying too hard. Look at their website. The prominent overall visual impression is you! It’s the word mark “mozilla”. That just works!</p> <p>Don’t know if this was mentioned before: If you want to have something connecting every past and future thing, as the head brand of things like FireFox, ThunderBird and SeaMonkey why not visualize the mother/head/origin of elements or animals? Something along those lines and name future events/projects accordingly. Just not too bloated. Not too abstract.</p> <p>This will be a very interesting process to follow for many people. Hope you get what you deserve in the long run. Don’t be shy to demand things over our public heads.</p> <p>Sincerely</p>",

Despite some of them being graphically interesting, they’re usability, communication value and durability are very questionable while visually they’re either generic, overly simplified or just visibly “forced” to work. Apart from Route A, the yellow black one. With a few minor tweeks it could be a great system and a very iconic one. It has minor applicability flaws but that’s very solvable, but it’s not just the best one among these, it’s overall great. Different in a good way, that is to say that it steps out of the overly crisp clean and generic design and the bland web product aesthetic and moves into a more graphically engaging one which I thing will be a beneficial factor even to the new users. It shows guts and reliability and has a classic value that it will surely acquire over time.<br> The others I think will fall very very VERY flat as they have zero mnemonic value as such, they’re systems are very uninteresting, forgetable and in some cases horribly banal or in the case of Impossible M, just too trendy. Which you’ll agree isn’t really a great thing considering you’ll probably have to burn another fortune to refresh it in a few years. The moz://a is something I’d buy from 99designs, so is Route G… I believe those two are something a first year design student would think of. That scafolded generic M is just a copy of the Melbourne city identity and Route B is just plain unreadable, and the pattern approach is not something a web product/service should rely on too much. Patterns are very ungreatful for web usage.<br> All in all I don’t think this is a great way of deciding either. Lay people tend to react on emotion but don’t understand the complexity of applying the system and maintainting it. So this overly democratic way of approaching this problem is much like being a high school girl who can’t decide what to wear and asks a bunch of friends, without having an attitude of herown.<br> Still, I vote Route A, it’s great in every way and a brave, involving and friendly way of communicating Mozilla. It says Mozilla visually! And the character is very cute which is gonna be a great asset since people will relate with it better. Also the system is so effortlessly open that it’s gonna be a breeze to apply it to all kinds of stuff.<br> Good luck with it, but despite what people say, test run them all and you’ll see that every one except A will become very very weak in the long run. And you wouldn’t want to change your logo in another few years like DC comics had to.<br> Cheers.</p>",

I’ve been designing logos professionally since 1980, and this is a winner: it will present well around the world, it is a symbol that transcends language while spelling out Mozilla, but with a subtle nod to the characters in languages other than English; by its technical, colorful geometric nature it will it will be able to show off modern digital technology superbly; it will absolutely stand the test of time; and it puts a fresh face on the brand, I believe it would tell the brand story well and position it among or above the industry leaders.</p> <p>The other designs are, with all due respect, off-target, amateurish, derivative or just plain ugly. This applies to their concept, structure and color scheme.</p> <p>My opinion of each design, in order of how they are shown:<br> 1. (The-Eye) Ugly. Derivative or rip off of World PBS channel with shapes and colors. Also makes me think: clunky, amateurish type handling, African Safari / primitive tribal, wild cat eye stalking me…<br> 2.

Seen it done hundreds of times.<br> 4. (The-Protocol) Meh. As wordmarks go, it’s clever, like the colors and classic typography, but as the signature image to tell your brand’s story, it fails. Too plain, too “coding is cool”, or “hey look, our logo suggests a URL”…again, meh. Also not fresh, distinctive or modern.<br> 5. Cool, I like this second best, but it totally rips off Microsoft’s Zune MP3 player (the logo was done by JDK, a company I used to work for) and it’s not as attractive with this black color scheme. And you know how Zune turned out. Also rips off Melbourne Australia’s identity, but not nearly as beautiful.<br> 6. Horrid. Ugh. Looks like an amateur played around in some paint program or Adobe Illustrator in 1987. Slightly clever as an exploration of the m shape, but do we need to conjure up visuals synonymous with the retro sensibilities of Roy Lichtenstein, MC Escher and the days of early laser printers and visible halftone dots? Not for a forward moving brand.<br> 7. WTF. A logo? Clever but way too obscure. Colors are too hipster organic. Also suggests house of cards, unstable, precarious, contrived.</p> <p>Thanks for the opportunity to rant. I spend my days poring through logo design books and online logo showcases when researching a new identity. I am passionate about logo design and I really like option 2. The explorations of how it would be treated on shirts, swag, sub brands, the different color schemes, the animation, etc. are proof of its versatility, adaptability and it stays fresh in each iteration. The rest are garbage. Odd that there is such a chasm between these options.</p>",

When you visit Mozilla.org in a few months, we hope that will present a clearer view of our purpose in the world through our people, technology, and products.

Bold colors are great, but these aren’t bold.  They’re like an assault on the retinas…  :)  I like blue a lot, but not this blue.  Maybe the dark blue from “Protocol” would work?  I would like this logo tons more with a slightly toned-down blue and red smile.  Or vise-versa.  The Mozilla Egypt version is much closer.  Perhaps that black with red internals as well.</p> <p>That being said, the design is really cool and I think it speaks a lot to openness.  Or “turning it on.”  I can’t speak to this being truly unique across the internet.  I’ve never seen it quite like this, but maybe I just don’t get around enough…  But I like how this is both an “on” button and a face.  It translates (to me) that it’s open for the people.  </p> <p>I think this logo translates really nicely to black and white, which is a real plus.  It would look really cool on a black or gray t-shirt with the blue part being black and the pink part being white.</p> <p>The MDN bag looks pretty awesome.  I’d buy one of those in a heartbeat.</p> <p>Do I just like everything I see?  No.  I really don’t like any of the other options, tbh.  Wireframe is the next best, perhaps.  But it would need work to make the M really look like an M.  </p> <p>I like the Escher-style “impossible” M, sort of.  The Shape of the M (the outside slants being SO slanted) and the colors used just look weak to me. Are the colored parts implying I should use “vi” ?</p> <p>So, in short, I think with some iteration on the coloring for Open-Button, we’d have a good one there.

People who butt heads and speak bluntly, without obscuring the message with paragraphs of corporate jargon. In fact, it’s that bluntly open attitude that’s managed to help Mozilla become a protector of both privacy and openness on the web itself.</p> <p>Maybe that’s why some people are rather put off by a lot of this, because I know this very post I’m replying to is what made me realize why I’m irked. It feels like this is just part of a corporate attempt to make Mozilla into a business, and the use of very business-oriented speech regarding this push to choose a new brand design language doesn’t help that image at all. </p> <p>As a long-time fan and advocate of Mozilla (even when I complain very openly about mistakes and missteps along the way), I see someone who is approaching this from a distance as part of “business as usual”, rather than a loose and casual member of Mozilla’s community. Not seeing that casual attitude in your replies—or some of your posts—makes it feel like this is something the community is only participating in, rather than a campaign that’s driven by actual Mozillians.</p> <p>That’s just my 2 pence, though.

I have left you with a feeling that I have an agenda that goes against what’s good for Mozilla. That was not my intention. I hope that one day we can meet in person instead of through pixels. I’d like to learn more about your experience with Mozilla and share mine with you. </p> <p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Tim and I am a Mozillian. I have been a Firefox user from the early days, and Mozilla staff member for more than a year. I came to Mozilla to help more people recognize us and understand what we do. That is what I have to offer this movement.</p> <p>Like any disciplines, marketing and branding use particular words to mean certain things. In my attempt to describe the process that got us here, to this step of exploring what our brand might look like, I made a lazy choice to use unfamiliar terms. I’ll try to be more clear this time.</p> <p>Mozilla must evolve how we talk about ourselves. Research conducted around the world shows that people don’t understand what we do (aside from making Firefox) and why we are here. Our community of volunteer contributors, our belief in putting people before profit, our role in keeping the Internet open — these are mostly invisible to our audience despite how passionately we believe in them.</p> <p>Our brand – not just how we look but what we talk about and how we say it – is a tool to help people understand us. While our community is helping to shape the brand, we are also tapping into designers outside the community, as well as current and potential users and supporters. Like open-source code, open design requires a combination of experience and many minds working together.  </p> <p>Thanks for reminding me to speak more clearly. Please let me know if this reply has not made a difference, and I’ll keep trying until it does.  </p> <p>I am grateful to be a Mozillian and to have been welcomed to link arms in this effort. I in turn look forward to greeting newcomers, making room for them, and discovering what talents they have. There are enough chairs at this table for everyone. Take care.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I’ve finally given my thoughts for each design on their respective pages, but I’d like to take a moment to mention something. First, I’d like to share what one of my boyfriends said about this subject:</p> <p>“Hello Mozilla. My friend has asked me to put a word in about the redesign project you are going through, and as I am not a UX designer or anything of the sort, I guess you could say my perspective is from that of a user/consumer. So here’s my two cents.</p> <p>You say that people only think of Mozilla as ‘the guys that make firefox’, and while this may be true in many aspects, these designs you are showing me tell me..well..nothing about Mozilla. They all look business like rather than personable, as you say you want to be seen. I look at those and wonder ‘what does any of this have to do with Mozilla?’.</p> <p>You have two mascots. The Firefox and Mozilla himself. You incorporated Firefox not only into the logo, but into many of the visuals on pages where Firefox itself is downloaded, and where you have information on it.</p> <p>Why do you ignore the little dinosaur that has grown with your company? Does he not represent you anymore? I would think that Mozilla the mascot would be more expressive than businesslike designs. After all, with all these designs you’ve shown me, I get no ‘feel’ of the company. Instead, what I feel is ‘well that’s boring’. </p> <p>Again, I’m no visual designer, just a consumer/user. But if you want me to feel the ‘Mozilla meaning’ whenever I visit/use something of yours, I’d like to think you want ‘this is who we are’ to be more than something that says ‘business as usual’.”</p> <p>With that passed along, I want to echo something that he said: The designs don’t feel like “Mozilla”. Rather, for me, they don’t feel like Mozilla _on their own_. Each of them fail when used individually, but when used together properly, they could form much more amazing designs. Much like the community itself having people who specialize in individual fields, combining some of them can make a greater “whole”.</p> <p>Try combining “The Impossible M”‘s logos with the general design of “The Connector”, or “Protocol”‘s main logo and theme with “The Impossible M”‘s project-specific logos. I think they’d look much better, and possibly be able to better convey Mozilla’s “brand” together than they could on their own.</p>",

      "content": "<p>This is definitely my favourite out of all the other concepts so far. Primarily because I feel like the others crucially miss some sort of mark in terms of what they focus on or what emotions they convey, especially on the feeling of openness or their capacity to carry messages with a positive and/or emotive tone.</p> <p>I feel that this one has the most capacity to engage with people who might not otherwise know who Mozilla is too; there feels like a very inviting nature about it – it’s not static, it’s not uniform and it’s comprised of many different parts. It feels like a very apt metaphor for values of openness and the internet. This system allows for a lot of flexibility to take the branding beyond the main logo, while maintaining some sort of underlying visual concept that allows the organisation to be consistent and recognised. </p> <p>I also like the fact that it doesn’t emphasise technology as much compared to other ideas – not that technology is important or not important to Mozilla, but because I think that to focus on technology can carry risks and miss more important points of an organisation. Because technology is invisible to so many people, making it a big focus risks seeming businessy or developer-centric, and it avoids opportunities to convey what I think would be the more distinctive, emotive and engaging aspects of an organisation, which is the use of the technology itself. So I like how this concept has this geometric structure can convey a sense of technology, but as more of a nod or contextual detail rather than giving technology itself a theme entirely on it’s own or a central focus.</p> <p>The Memphis-esque rainbow colour scheme for the default logo is definitely not going to stand the test of time, but that is something that can easily change. I’m not entirely certain about how other aesthetic aspects would stand the test of time but I think it’s basics – the use of interlocking geometric shapes it’s a very good starting point, and the geometric simplicity certainly helps lend it to possibilities to develop in the future as needs and design trends change.</p> <p>Like others have said, I’m concerned about the recognisability of the the current compact/square logo at a distance. For me, it’s not simply because the lines create too much detail, just the lack of a distinctive overall silhouette/form. There possibly needs to be something to visually stabilise it so it avoids looking just like an isolated part of a tessellating pattern.</p>",

A quick glance at the<a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/type/before-after/index.php?page=19#.V7y-YBIrJE5\"> Before/After</a> section of<a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/\"> Brand New</a>, the well-known design blog dedicated to the critique of such things, shows 216 projects chronicled year-to-date.</p><p>Some redesigns have been well received like<a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3050613/googles-new-logo-is-its-biggest-update-in-16-years\"> Google</a>’s, while others have drawn an enormous amount of criticism from both the design community and the general public, such as<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/02/news/companies/uber-logo-rebrand/\"> Uber</a>’s. These are interesting times for design as the critique of our work has moved from something those of us in the trade might discuss with colleagues over dinner, to something that anyone with an @handle and opinion can weigh in publicly over social media. On several occasions, this public discourse has taken such an extreme tone that Andrew Beck has described it as<a href=\"http://beckandstone.com/thought/on-design-criticism-inspiration-and-purpose.html\"> design crit as bloodsport</a>.</p><p><b>Designing in the Open</b></p><p>Earlier this year I began consulting with non-profit<a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/\"> Mozilla</a> to tee up a logo redesign initiative. During that time, Mozilla’s Creative Director Tim Murray proposed the idea of<a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/\"> designing in the open</a>. His vision was to build off of the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software\"> open source</a> principles that are bedrock to Mozilla by applying them to the end-to-end process of an identity redesign. The idea was to be as transparent as possible with the process, the initial concepts, the refinement and the outcome, and to have an open, public dialog with many people as possible along the way. He would engage the typical stakeholders one would expect, such as Mozilla’s senior leadership, as well as Mozilla’s 10,000+ strong<a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/\"> volunteer community</a>. But Tim also wanted to reach beyond Mozillians. He invited not only the design community into the discussion, but anyone for whom the Mozilla mission – to keep the internet healthy, open and safe for all – resonates.</p><p>Initially, his proposal made me slightly uncomfortable. I felt a mix of caution and curiosity and I had to ask myself: why?</p><p><b>A Mix of Caution and Curiosity</b></p><p>I was concerned that opening up earlier stages of the design process to that kind of public commentary (think stakeholders at scale) would negatively affect the work. And my hesitancy was also rooted in a lack of understanding as to<a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/about/\"> what Mozilla was asking</a> from the design community. I questioned how we as designers could meaningfully participate in a public dialog about design work. After all, by submitting a professional opinion on everything from initial thinking, to design exploration through concept and execution, <i>weren’t we engaging in a kind of spec work?</i></p><p>As for my curiosity, it was piqued by the opportunity to re-examine the methodology by which design outcomes are generated. Would a larger and more diverse conversation upfront in fact lead to a better outcome? And as design crit has gone mainstream and instantaneous thanks to social media, how can we show up in public conversations about design deliverables without compromising our point of view<a href=\"http://www.aiga.org/position-spec-work/\"> against spec work</a>?</p><p><b>Where Things Stand Now</b></p><p>The<a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/\"> identity redesign</a> is now well underway.<a href=\"http://johnsonbanks.co.uk/\"> johnson banks</a> was selected as the agency partner and Mozilla has indeed undertaken a fully transparent, moderated, and public design process. The<a href=\"http://johnsonbanks.co.uk/thoughtfortheweek/our-first-design-routes-for-mozilla/\"> first round creative concepts</a> were shared a week ago and met with hundreds if not thousands of responses and a full news cycle in the<a href=\"https://www.creativereview.co.uk/mozilla-rebrand-seven-design-routes/\"> design press</a>.</p><p>While the end result of this unconventional approach remains uncertain, we do know that Tim and team created a process that is true to Mozilla’s open source beliefs and the<a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/\"> manifesto</a> that guides the company’s conduct. And we know they are willing to withstand the outcome even if it rises to the level of<i> bloodsport.</i> For that, they should be commended.</p><p>As for the questions raised about spec work and the Mozilla initiative, if you’re aligned with Mozilla’s mission and choose to provide critique then your participation as a practicing professional is an act of volunteerism. In their words…</p><p>“What we’re seeking is input on work that’s in process. We welcome your feedback in a form that suits you best, be it words, napkin sketches, or Morse Code. We simply want to incorporate as many perspectives and voices into this open design process as possible. We don’t take any single contribution lightly. We hope you’ll agree that by helping Mozilla communicate its purpose better through design, you’ll be helping improve the future Internet.”</p><p>As for the larger questions raised by increasing public dialog about design, it’s up to each of us personally to determine how we participate and when. But all industries experience change, design is no exception. By at least trying to understand Mozilla’s approach to this project and how it fits within a broader narrative, designers can use this as an opportunity to challenge long-held methodologies, and perhaps pave the way for new ones<b>.</b></p><p><a href=\"http://aigasf.org\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-392\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/09/AIGAsf_logo-300x120.jpg\" alt=\"aigasf_logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"120\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/09/AIGAsf_logo-300x120.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/09/AIGAsf_logo.jpg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p><p><em>Republished with permission from AIGA SF / The Professional Association for Design<br></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons “And Phoebus’ Tresses Stream Athwart the Glade” </em></p>",

First impressions are of a brand with a lot of personality and memorability. It will be very easy for people to recall this logo, and the identity that can be built around it will be personable and captivating, to say nothing of going back to Mozilla’s roots (I had, full disclosure, thought the last iteration of Dino to be conceptually the weakest of its bunch and had advocated for other concepts in that round). That said, I agree with the comments above in that it may be too childish at present. Some exploration of the personality of that dino is in order!</p>",

If you want to play the negative space game, take a look at the FedEx logo/arrow mash-up for how this works. Fire: Lovely symbolism, but gosh, a bit too common, unless we want to have a strong relationship to FIREfox.</p> <p>Burst: Great strategic thinking here but the execution is kind of an art school exercise that hurts my eyes.</p> <p>One last thought: I’m attaching an image here from an email newsletter I got (the origin of which I’ve forgotten, I did not create it).

(Please forgive my lack of technical language here.) Where many corporate entities would prefer that people remain in their proprietary silos, we believe that users of the Internet should be able to go wherever they want.

It’s a somewhat esoteric observation. Even if you were to accept the notion that kids in 5+ years won’t have any idea what that is referencing, the treatment still effective. The effect is not so much that it appropriates the protocol as it appropriates coding languages and web specific type treatments in general (that’s why the emoji work). I think that more and more kids will be learning coding as time goes on, and this reference will not be lost on them.</p>",

One of the values in the <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mozilla Manifesto</a> points to how important we feel transparency and participation are to fostering trust and community. We are obligated to conduct this Open Design process in full view; we wouldn’t have it any other way; and johnson banks eagerly joined us in trying something different.  </p> <p>How should designers react to an ever more connected world? Do we continue to create in isolation or might we look for ways to include others in our creative process? We hope that this experiment may offer some clarity around those questions. We are not crowd-sourcing a solution or voting on a result here. No one has been asked to do spec work. And in addition to this online solicitation of comments, we’re holding live crit sessions and will be conducting a global consumer survey starting next week. All of these sources of feedback are valuable as we determine our path forward. We are making good progress. Although it may look messy, what design process at this phase doesn’t? </p> <p>Thanks for coming along for the ride. It will be interesting to see where we end up!</p>",

On the other hand, this design remains the colors of the old foxie. Those red, yellow and orange shades remind the old design and provide an emotional link with the past. It makes easier to accept and internalize the innovation. I found other designs much more “tech focused” and in my opinion blue/ green shades put distance between the brand and users. Flame design creates a “warm” feeling with the color &amp; shape, plus it still remains the tech perception by the dotted/ pixelled look.

Sans-serif feels too “now” and won’t stick around. Flame seems random even if pretty (and using the dots is cool if arbitrary), burst makes no real sense (I know it spells an “M” but who cares if it’s that distracting) – the spinning makes me think of gears, but they have no obvious mechanical relationship to each other and it also seems meaningless related to Mozilla’s purpose. Dino-2 is cute (ish) but the heavy bottom jaw is distracting and visually unbalanced, and the purpose again meaningless other than to be a dinosaur (and yes, I really actually am wearing dinosaur socks to work today even as I type that).</p>",

It’s a shining light. The flame brings people together. The flame is open and bold. The flame is warm and bright. And how could you miss Mozilla FIREfox? (I know Mozilla is trying to differentiate itself from Firefox, but this connection’s not going to confuse anyone).</p> <p>The logo is very nice to look at, and stands out. I like that there’s still some of the red in it, though it’s not afraid to expand it’s pallate. The circular pixels give a modern touch without coming off as too geeky or too cold. The logo is warm and inviting, while hinting at power. It’s flexible, able to take on any color while still keeping it’s form and distinctiveness.</p> <p>I saw a few people say they didn’t see the M in the logo, but I liked it before I noticed anyway.</p> <p>I like this design. The warmth, the flexibility, the uniqueness, and it just looks good. I would also definitely wear it.</p> <p>Also one more thing:<br> Why not keep the current typeface for the wordmark? I can’t see a reason not to. It’s a very readable font and it’s been part of the wordmark for a while. Personally I think you should keep the typeface, but either way this design route is fantastic.</p>",

Think of people that were not exposed to the brand. Apart from this problem, the logo is perfect, and the problem can be mitigated by NOT writing the name in this form ever, in text. Just use the logo in graphical form, and write the name normally in any text reference. </p> <p>Regarding the colors – the logo should use only one color – as brand color (think Coca Cola is red, Hertz is orange, IBM is blue). The color choice should be based on brand differentiation (not taste, some psychological association etc.) – use the color that’s not used by your competitors – just map them on a color wheel and choose from what’s left. Explorer (and Safari) are blue, so bye-bye blue. Chrome is rainbow, but you see red first (and Opera is red) so no red, too. But Firefox is orange, and orange is not used by anyone, so… keep the orange!</p>",

If it evolved into something more mature and potentially dangerous, then maybe it could represent a brand that saw itself as a protector of the internet. Besides, there is the inherent issue of dinosaurs and extinction, despite all previous connections with the Mozilla brand…</p> <p>Burst:<br> I seem to be in the minority, but I like the subtle movement and the M. Of all of them, it reminds me of another tech company in a highly positive way. When you update iOS, the gears in the icon slowly rotate. If you aren’t paying attention, you never notice it. I’ve always loved that subtle attention to detail. Does it make crazy moiré patterns when you scroll? Yes. Is there something that’s maybe a bit too art school or graphic design project about it? Without a doubt. But, this stands out as both a still image and an animation in a way the others don’t.</p> <p>Flame:<br> It’s a flame. If the flame resembled a fox, or a fox appeared while the flames were moving, then it resolved into an M, you might have something. As it is, it’s no good.</p> <p>Protocol:<br> It’s got a colon and forward slashes because internet. Reminds me of way too many ads, news transitions, even the date/location text that you see all the time in movies. Go ahead and make it green letters on a black background, and we’ll all go ‘Oh, the Matrix!’ Plus, it’s boring and ugly. Just no.</p>",

Maybe the M but not as a flame?</p> <p>The Star Burst – really has a lot going for it…some refining could push this over the top…fewer spokes and thicker lines both for the M and the bursts could help…but adding text over top of this makes it very noisy.  As a design system very good…as a logo…refinement needed.</p> <p>Protocol…good ol’ corporate blue…the most used color in the book. Maybe softer edges…and if you knock out the text so it’s see through (representing mozilla’s transparency) this might work.

When I hit your front page I’m sort of left guessing as to what you provide…it feels like your hiding everything behind a word with no explanation. </p> <p>(You kind of explain it in your blurb.. ” Using the web as the platform, we build open, innovative technologies that allow developers to work free of closed, corporate ecosystems and create faster, safer web experiences for us all. ” You make technologies?…and then you list things like Rust and Servo with no explanation as to what they are…and I guess you have a browser? Don’t get me wrong – the page is pretty and well thought out…just I have no idea what’s what.  A few more explanatory notes would be helpful).</p> <p>Here’s hoping your rebrand kicks in the clarity. Intrigued to see where you go.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Flame: I looked at the detailed version of Flame, and I actually find it to be fairly consistent with some of the other open source logos – I don’t understand why the “mozilla” part of that logo was cut out, because in its current form on this post, there is no discernible link to Mozilla at all. That being said, perhaps if the logo needs the “mozilla” text, perhaps it’s not distinctive enough.</p> <p>I think one of the main reasons everyone is very pro-Protocol is that it is the only reasonable logo that actually says “Mozilla” (the Dino looks so childish I can’t really take it seriously). I’d suggest updating the Flame in this post to include the grey “mozilla” that’s present in the detailed Flame blog post – I think the current version is extremely confusing and actually kind of misleading.<br> —<br> Protocol: This logo is tying Mozilla to browsers, and since we are trying to move Mozilla to a bigger space than just Firefox, this really seems counterproductive. I like the visual pun, I like the nod to browsers, but this really shouldn’t be the logo because it’s regressing the mission by boxing it into a smaller space. Please talk to some Mozilla leadership, or listen to Mitchell Baker’s talks about going beyond the browser, or talk to some high level product people – tying the brand more tightly to browsers is *not* going to help further the Mozilla mission. I’ve commented more earlier in the thread so I won’t repeat myself any more here.<br> —<br> Burst: I looked at the detailed post about Burst, and I find the thumbnail versions to be quite nice, because the “M” for Mozilla is clear and stands out, and even looks a little like a constellation. However, in the large version that’s up here, the line bursts are overwhelming and detract as well as distract from the underlying “M” of the logo. It’s nearly impossible to focus on the M, which I think is a failure of this logo. Perhaps a different version would work, but not in its current incarnation.<br> —<br> Dino: This is just so childish, I can’t take it seriously. I like the Dino, I think it looks cute, but this version would be better suited to a funny sticker rather than the overarching logo of a global company devoted to fighting for the openness of the web. The animations in the extended blog post really just confirm my feeling that this is kind of a cutsey rebranding, and I really don’t think internet privacy and user choice and open web can effectively be represented as “cute”.<br> —</p> <p>In general, I think there’s a lot of pushback from the community because these logos just seem random and don’t do a good job of relating to the Mozilla mission, and at best seem to only fixate on a tiny part of it. It’s so myopic that I am starting to feel uncomfortable about whether the company that we have hired/partnered with actually understands the breadth and depth that Mozilla encompasses.</p> <p>If anything, I’d really just prefer the current logo, because in a lot of ways, it doesn’t pigeonhole Mozilla into one of these tiny categories, and also isn’t so vague as to seem like nothing but a vain, meaningless “brand facelift”. I guess I feel like a rebrand should help focus the world on what Mozilla stands for, and these either seem overly focused on one tiny aspect of Mozilla, or don’t mean anything at all.</p>",

The wordmark that says “Mozilla?” The most successful brand identities do indeed suggest the purpose of an organization in the world. A logo also plays a role in driving recognition, so that over time, one associates the symbol with the brand. One could argue that Protocol and Dino-2.0 are the more recognizable of the four designs, while Burst and Flame begin to suggest the overall purpose of Mozilla (championing the health of the Internet and being the keeper of the flame, respectively). In general as time passes, recognition comes from repeated exposure to a consistently applied brand identity. The Achilles heel of our past approach, in which teams, locales, and initiatives have been encouraged to make up their own identities, is that these many different looks contribute to confusion about what Mozilla does, believes, and stands for. If you had to select one image to convey the totality of Mozilla, what would it be? Thanks again.</p>",

      "content": "<p>After thinking about all of these designs, this is what I’ve come to.</p> <p>Dino-2.0 – While I can tell there was a good amount of creative effort put into this one, but I really don’t have much of anything positive to say for it. When I asked people I know about the four logos, this one got little attention, and what it did get wasn’t very positive. All-in-all, this odd looking and slightly unsettling thing doesn’t say much to me about Mozilla – other than “weird”.</p> <p>Burst – This one exists. It’s a graph thing. The description for it sounds very corporate and it looks like a line graph. It doesn’t really say much about Mozilla unless you plan on becoming an analytics company. It scales across different screens oddly and it’s apparently made people’s eyes feel weird. It exists, I don’t like it much and I don’t see much creative potential with it. It doesn’t look ugly or creepy and it doesn’t leave a really bad impression. It just doesn’t leave much of an impression at all.</p> <p>Flame – Warm, flexible, and modern. That’s what came to mind when I looked at this logo. After the previous generation of design concepts I was pleasantly surprised by this one (as well as Protocol 2.0). It’s neat and seems to be a favorite among people I show it to. The logo is nice to look at and the narrative fits Mozilla very well. The flame just works, and of course it fits well with Firefox too. I struggled to find any criticism for it. The only thing I’ve come up with for a negative is that you didn’t use the Mozilla fonts. Flame would look fine next to the trusty old Meta Bold wordmark, and I should maybe remind you that “re-branding” doesn’t mean “get rid of all resemblance to old branding”. Fonts aside, this is a great design route and I would be very happy to see Mozilla go with it.</p> <p>Protocol 2.0 – While I wasn’t as much of a fan of it at first, especially the first version, this one has grown on me. It’s professional and clean, without feeling too cold or corporate. It was my Graphic Design Teacher’s favorite (Flame being his second) and I can pretty well see why. While I still can’t say that I like this one better than Flame, I can say that I like it.</p> <p>Between Flame and Protocol 2.0, I prefer flame, but I’d be happy to see Mozilla use either. That said, I do hope you don’t leave your trusty fonts out in the cold. They’re readable and they stand out in a sea of generic serif and sans-serif fonts. The current fonts have this wonderful balance of modernism and class, mixed with a little personality. Just wanted to mention them to be sure you weren’t planning on getting rid of them. This typography is huge part of Mozilla’s brand, which is why I felt the need to talk about it here.</p> <p>Back to logos – After careful consideration, here’s how I rate each design:<br> Flame – very good<br> Protocol 2.0 – also good<br> Burst – So forgettable I had to stop and remember what the name of it was<br> Dino-2.0 – Let’s not do that please</p> <p>Thanks for reading, I’ve been wanting to express all this for a while.<br> I hope that even though I’m not a professional programmer, I can contribute something.</p> <p>–\tSam</p>",

About 100 graphic designers and brand experts stayed after our presentation to share some snacks and their initial reactions.</p><p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHVBjdznUtA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><p>Since then, we’ve continued to refine the work and started to gather feedback through quantitative testing, reflecting the great advice and counsel we’ve received online and in person. While we’ve continued to work on all four designs, Dino-2.0 and Flame&nbsp;show the most dramatic progress in response to feedback from conference attendees and Mozillians. We wanted to refine these designs prior to testing with broader audiences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Meet Dino-2.1 </b></p><p>Our early work on Dino-2.0 focused on communicating that Mozilla is opinionated, bold, and unafraid to be different. Embodying the optimism and quirkiness of our culture, the minimalist design of this dinosaur character needed to extend easily to express our wide array of programs, communities, events, and initiatives. Dino-2.0 met the challenge.</p><p>On the other hand, the character’s long jaw reminded some commenters of an alligator and others of a red stapler. Colleagues also pointed out that it’s playfulness might undermine serious topics and audiences. Would we be less believable showing up to testify about encryption with a dino logo smiling from our briefcases?</p><p>So the dinosaur has continued to evolve. A hand-cut font helps shorten the jaw while a rounder outline shifts the mis-perception that we sell office supplies. After much debate, we also decided to make the more serious Mozilla portion – the upper part of the jaw – the core mark.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-489\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_2-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-490\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_3-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-491\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_4-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-492\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-dino_3oct-blog_5-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>Wait, does that doom the dino character? Not at all. </p><p>Since the bulk of our Mozilla brand expression occurs on screens, this shift would allow the animated dino to show an even wider range of emotions. Digitally, the core mark can come to life and look surprised, hungry, or &nbsp;annoyed as the situation warrants, without having those expressions show up on a printed report to Congress. And our communities would still have the complete Dino head to use as part of their own self expression.</p><p>Should Dino-2.1 end up as one of our finalists, we’ll continue to explore its expressions. Meanwhile, let us know what you think of this evolution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Making Flame eternal. </b></p><p>The ink was still moist on Flame, our newest design direction, when we shared it in Nashville. We felt the flame metaphor was ideal for Mozilla, referencing being a torch-bearer for an equal, accessible internet, and offering a warm place for community to gather. Even so, would a newcomer seeing our name next to a traditional flame assume we were a religious organization? Or a gas company? We needed a flame that was more of the Web and more our own.</p><p>So we asked: what if our core mark was in constant motion — an eternal flame that represents and reinforces our purpose? Although we haven’t landed on the exact Flame or the precise font, we are on a better design path now.</p><p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/185292705?loop=1&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"820\" height=\"461\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-494\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_2-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-495\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_3-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-496\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_4-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-497\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5.jpg\" alt=\"mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/mozilla-flame_3oct-blog_5-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Should the Flame make it into our final round, we will continue to explore different flame motions, shapes, and static resting states, along with a flexible design system.

It also embodies many of the traits Mozilla strives to embody through their work on the open web. It’s a force to reckoned with but it is also warm and comforting.<br> Both Dino-2.1 and protocol 2.0 are distinguishable logos that feed off what Mozilla is and does and work well in animation and decontructed environments. The dinorsaur worries me with is crocodial-ish look and whimsical demeanor. Protocol 2.0 has promising visuals With the use of commonly used glyphs relaxing text. This emediatly gives the viewer a good idea of what Mozilla does to a short extent. The font change is nice with a more universal style and animation could lead to great copy write campaigns. My only concern is that to some viewers the style and use of :// may not come across and give off a sense of alienation to those who do not understand it’s use.<br> -M</p>",

C’mon guys, push a little bit here…is your branding company even trying? Sorry for harshing on your mellow, but the above three could have been explored just a little more. Perhaps were not seeing the thousands of comps that were made to get here. </p> <p>The Fire – ok, now you have some push as in you have taken an original idea and pushed it further, as in seriously moved it. Has merit, and potential. Not quite in the likeable stage since the “flame” doesn’t have a distinct flame shape, and the colors may be a bit too subtle. Go with your reds and oranges that already exist add a strong yellow, making your dots more hard flat colors, and make the flame more flamey (whatever that means, i think a wider base on the flame would help), and perhaps incorporate the hard outline directly into the moving flame (perhaps only on ones side of each shape) to distinguish the shapes some.</p> <p>But maybe the idea here isn’t a flame anymore  – but perhaps some sort of nebulous cloud/crowd, a conglomeration of shapes (read people) of various colors, sizes, combinations, connections, overlap representing openness, working together and all the  other things that represent “Mozilla”. And then make it an auto-generated shape so it’s different every time but based on the core structure as shown in the outlined view. (But don’t make it a flame anymore). The distinction comes from the fact you’re using this fractal approach. </p> <p>Ah. Move from flame to fractal.</p> <p>I think this will end up giving you guys the most flexibility, the combinations can be endless, and the applications suitable to the organization as a whole.

Burst is way to complex and I do not associate Flame with you.</p> <p>The dino on the other hand is pretty unique and has followed you a long time. I was reading a blog on corporate logo redesigns (<a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/</a>) some time back and looking at the examples it was clear to my that the most successful redesigns were the ones that managed to take something people recognize and update it just enough to make it look fresh and new. Generally I think the results for companies that decided to let more or less go of their previous identity were much less successful. It is positive that the dino’s lower jaw has been shortened (look less like a stapler) but I still think the design is way to minimalistic and needs to pay more homage to the old dino designs. It does simply not have enough character. The idea of only using the upper jaw is terrible as it really limits the ways the logo can be used. I know that minimalistic and flat design is everywhere but this is only the more of a reason to come up with something more complex as I think Dino-2.1 quickly could end up looking dated.</p> <p>Protocol is still good but as many pointed out the color is very different from your current colors. I understand that it is a reference to early links but would still prefer your current color scheme. Maybe also experiment more with some different fonts?</p>",

The link’s role in connecting people to online know-how, opportunity and knowledge is worth preserving and fighting for.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-505\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-9.56.54-PM.png\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-10-19-at-9-56-54-pm\" width=\"1572\" height=\"870\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-9.56.54-PM.png 1572w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-9.56.54-PM-300x165.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-9.56.54-PM-600x332.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-9.56.54-PM-1000x553.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1572px) 100vw, 1572px\"></p><p><strong>But consumers think differently.</strong></p><p>We surveyed people making up our target audience, 400 each in the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, India, Brazil, and Mexico. They are 18- to 34-year-old active citizens who make brand choices based on values, are more tech-savvy than average, and do first-hand research before making decisions (among other factors).</p><p>We asked them first to rank order the brand attributes most important for a non-profit organization “<em>focused on empowering people and building technology products to keep the internet healthy, open and accessible for everyone</em>.” They selected <strong>Trustworthy</strong> and <strong>Welcoming</strong> as their top attributes. And then we also asked them to evaluate each of the four brand identity design systems against each of the seven brand attributes. For this audience, the design system that best fit these attributes was Burst.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-504\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-9.57.18-PM.png\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-10-19-at-9-57-18-pm\" width=\"1566\" height=\"876\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-9.57.18-PM.png 1566w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-9.57.18-PM-300x168.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-9.57.18-PM-600x336.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-9.57.18-PM-1000x559.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1566px) 100vw, 1566px\"></p><p>Why would this consumer audience choose Burst? Since this wasn’t a qualitative survey, we don’t know for sure, but we surmise that the colorful design, rounded forms, and suggestion of interconnectedness felt appropriate for an unfamiliar nonprofit. It looks like a logo.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-418\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/09/jb_Mozilla-sept_B_burst_2.jpg\" alt=\"jb_mozilla-sept_b_burst_2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/09/jb_Mozilla-sept_B_burst_2.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/09/jb_Mozilla-sept_B_burst_2-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/09/jb_Mozilla-sept_B_burst_2-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/09/jb_Mozilla-sept_B_burst_2-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>Also of note, Burst’s strategic narrative focused on what an open, healthy Internet feels and acts like, while the strategic narratives for the other design systems led with Mozilla’s role in world. This is a signal that our targeted consumer audience, while they might not be familiar with Mozilla, may share our vision of what the Internet could and should be.</p><p>Why didn’t they rank Protocol more highly across the chosen attributes? We can make an educated guess that these consumers found it one dimensional by comparison, and they may have missed the meaning of the :// embedded in the wordmark.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-510\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-10.24.16-PM.png\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-10-19-at-10-24-16-pm\" width=\"1492\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-10.24.16-PM.png 1492w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-10.24.16-PM-300x211.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-10.24.16-PM-600x422.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-19-at-10.24.16-PM-1000x704.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1492px) 100vw, 1492px\"></p><p>Although Dino-2.0 and Flame had their fans, neither of these design directions sufficiently communicated our desired brand attributes, as proven by the qualitative survey results as well as through conversations with Mozillians and others in the design community. By exploring them, we learned a lot about how to describe and show certain facets of what Mozilla offers to the world. But we will not be pursuing either direction.</p><p><strong>Where we go from here.</strong></p><p>Both Protocol and Burst have merits and challenges. Protocol is distinctly Mozilla, clearly about the Internet, and it reinforces our mission that the web stay healthy, accessible, and open. But as consumer testing confirmed, it lacks warmth, humor, and humanity. From a design perspective, the visual system surrounding it is too limited.</p><p>By comparison, Burst feels fresh, modern, and colorful, and it has great potential in its 3D digital expression. As a result, it represents the Internet as a place of endless, exciting connections and possibilities, an idea reinforced by the strategic narrative. Remove the word “Mozilla,” though, and are there enough cues to suggest that it belongs to us?</p><p>Our path forward is to take the strongest aspects of Burst—its greater warmth and dimensionality, its modern feel—and apply them to Protocol. Not to Frankenstein the two together, but to design a new, final direction that builds from both. We believe we can make Protocol more relatable to a non-technical audience, and build out the visual language surrounding it to make it both harder working and more multidimensional.</p><p><strong>Long live the link.</strong></p><p>What do we say to Protocol’s critics who have voiced concern that Mozilla is hitching itself to an Internet language in decline? We’re doubling down on our belief in the original intent of the Internet—that people should have the ability to explore, discover and connect in an unfiltered, unfettered, unbiased environment. Our mission is dedicated to keeping that possibility alive and well.</p><p>For those who are familiar with the Protocol prompt, using the language of the Internet in our brand identity signals our resolve. For the unfamiliar, Protocol will offer an opportunity to start a conversation about who we are and what we believe. The language of the Internet will continue to be as important to building its future as it was in establishing its origin.</p><p>We’ll have initial concepts for a new, dare-we-say final design within a few weeks. To move forward, first we’ll be taking a step back. We’ll explore different graphic styles, fonts, colors, motion, and surrounding elements, making use of the design network established by our agency partner johnson banks. In the meantime, tell us what you think.</p>",

A strong identity for a large organisation needs to be simple enough to be functional and understandable, generic enough that it doesn’t lock the group too tightly into anything, and flexible enough to fit into whatever situation might be needed for it.<br> From my view, at least, none of these directions meet any of these criteria.<br> I’m really disappointed I didn’t get to participate more fully in this process, because Mozilla is an organisation that I support very heavily and means a lot to me. Still, I hope the designers directly in charge of this take a more critical look at these approaches and work them out more clearly. A few months is tight for a plan to completely rebrand, and I believe more time and thought is needed before a strong identity can be built.<br> “If it ‘aint broke, don’t fix it” may be questionable when dealing with many things, but in this case, I feel it applies. The current Mozilla design is achieving the stated goals perfectly fine, and it’s better to stay with something that works fine now, than to make something new that may step backwards.</p>",

Granted, while protocol is not the public’s top choice in design it promotes a greater opportunity to teach and educate those outside the world of the current Mozilla we know. To those who understand and follow Mozilla presently Protocol represents a understandable change to brand identity featuring positive connection to the community and major icons of everyday lives. Protocol also calls for the greater education and incorporation of a larger group of users and individuals who do not associate with or know of Mozilla. Their misunderstanding quite possibly could become a catalyst for users to explore the world of Mozilla, its products, and its opportunities. In itself the logo is creating its own “call and answer” to lead the public to a greater more open web. </p> <p>While the public seems to support Burst more it lacks integral character aspect of the brand and mission of Mozilla. In my opinion the public finds comfort and interest in its fun and exciting shape, other than that i’m not sure they understand its implication or if it would elicit any other response from the public other than produce more confusion and blur the direct connection between Mozilla and its products and services. </p> <p>In conclusion is it not better to offer up a new identity the begs a question to be answered through interest and the possible misunderstanding in some and a logical progression to those who already understand, compared to a pretty idea? </p> <p>We are not “Slaying the Beast” we are educating others and progressing our “Beast” into the new and developing world. If we are not flexible with change we will find ourselves outdated and overlooked. We don’t have to be shine and sugary but we do need to promote a better internet and more educated society.

      "content": "<p>From a design perspective, I think that Dino-2.0 is the best logo.</p> <p>The name Mozilla is very unique. It is only one syllable away from Godzilla, which is the only common ‘word’ with a similar sound and so the two are likely to be associated for most people. To try and separate them would be a waste of an opportunity on our part. Why use the ‘-zilla’ suffix if we don’t want to be associated with Godzilla or a dinosaur. This would be like Apple not using an apple for its logo.</p> <p>Another reason is that a red dinosaur has represented the Mozilla organization for 18 years since it was founded in 1998, and a green one represented the project before that. It is likely that people still expect a red dinosaur to represent us.</p> <p>Possibly another reason is that our products, which are likely the first interaction people will have with us, are almost all represented by animals. Our front-end products, Firefox (our most popular product which is used by hundreds of millions of people) and Thunderbird, are represented by a fox and a bird respectively. While our back-end product, Gecko, is represented by a gecko. Even Servo is represented by a dog in its logo. I think it is reasonable that people expect an organization that represents its products with animals to represent itself with a kind of animal (especially when its name is itself associated with a kind of animal, and yes a dinosaur is a kind of animal).</p> <p>However, I strongly believe that our old dinosaur logo is too abstract and that a future logo should include our name in the logo and not as a separable wordmark. (It is impossible to establish what our old logo represents without the word ‘Mozilla’ next to it or prior knowledge).</p> <p>As your studies suggest, I believe Protocol 2.0 will intimidate people who don’t understand syntax. They might even recognise the syntax in the logo and associate it with software development, but then wrongly assume that Mozilla is only for people who can develop software (why else would this be featured in our logo). Also, as Design Thinker said, many people will recognise the syntax as an ‘almost sad face’ (ie ?). Do we want to appeal only to people with a knowledge of software development and be associated with a negative emotion.</p> <p>Your objective is to “refresh” (i.e. update not replace) the Mozilla brand and “make it easier for people who don’t know us to get to know us” (ie people outside of Mozilla).</p> <p>In your first study, you asked people inside of Mozilla to rate these logos against seven brand attributes. Five of them are qualities that you would “like Mozilla to be known for in the future” (ie ‘wanted’ but not ‘needed’). The other two (‘unique’ and ‘appealing’) are qualities that are “required”. These results show that Protocol 2.0 and Dino-2.0 are the most popular logos among people inside of Mozilla. Protocol 2.0 won with an average of 39% while Dino-2.0 won with an average of 52%, and of the two ‘required’ qualities, Protocol 2.0 won with 40% and Dino-2.0 won with 60%. Thus, Protocol 2.0 represents the ‘wanted’ qualities more than the other logos, while Dino-2.0 represents the ‘required’ qualities more than the other logos.</p> <p>You also asked people outside of Mozilla that represent our target audience to rank six brand attributes against these logos. They ranked ‘trustworthy’ and ‘welcoming’ as the most important attributes. These results show that Burst was the most ‘welcoming’ and the most ’trustworthy’. Of the four logos, Dino-2.0 was ranked 3rd for ‘appealing’, 2nd for ‘trustworthy’, 2nd for ‘innovative’, 2nd for ‘welcoming’, 3rd for ‘activist’, and 2nd for ‘opinionated’, while Protocol 2.0 was ranked 4th for ‘appealing’, 4th for ‘trustworthy’, 3rd for ‘innovative’, 4th for ‘welcoming’, 4th for ‘activist’, and 4th for ‘opinionated’. Thus, of the two preferred logos of people inside of Mozilla, Dino-2.0 was ranked above Protocol 2.0 for every attribute.</p> <p>Your results clearly show that Dino-2.0 is approved by both people inside and outside of Mozilla and best represents the ‘required’ qualities of a brand to be successful and the highest ranked attributes of our target audience.</p> <p>From this, I can only suggest that we use Dino-2.0. It’s a good balance between what people both inside and outside of Mozilla believe should represent us and it retains our existing brand without abandoning it (see my attachment).</p> <p>Personally, the outline even reminds me of the Australis design, specifically the curved tabs that are used in Firefox, Thunderbird, and the top of every Mozilla webpage.

      "content": "<p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve been exploring different iterations of our brand identity system. We know we need a solution that represents both who Mozilla is today and where we’re going in the future, and appeals both to people who know Mozilla well and new audiences who may not know or understand Mozilla yet. If you’re new to this project, you can read all about our journey on <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/\">our blog</a>, and the <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/nearly-there/\">most recent post </a>about the two different design directions that are informing this current round of work.</p><p><i>[TL;DR: Our “Protocol” design direction delivers well on our mission, legacy and vision to build an Internet as a global public resource that is healthy, open and accessible to all. Based on quantitative surveys, Mozillians and developers believe this direction does the best job supporting an experience that’s innovative, opinionated and inclusive, the attributes we want to be known for. &nbsp;In similar surveys, our target consumers evaluated our “Burst” design direction as the better option in terms of delivering on those attributes, and we also received feedback that this direction did a good job communicating interconnectedness and liveliness. Based on all of this feedback, our decision was to lead with the “Protocol” design direction, and explore ways to infuse it with some of the strengths of the “Burst” direction.]</i></p><p>Here’s an update on what we’ve been up to:</p><p><b>Getting to the heart of the matter</b></p><p>Earlier in our open design project, we conducted quantitative research to get statistically significant insights from our different key audiences (Mozillians, developers, consumers), and used these data points to inform our strategic decision about which design directions to continue to refine.</p><p>At this point of our open design project, we used qualitative research to understand better what parts of the refined identity system were doing a good job creating that overall experience, and what was either confusing or contradictory. We want Mozilla to be known and experienced as a non-profit organization that is innovative, opinionated and inclusive, and our logo and other elements in our brand identity system – like color, language and imagery – need to reinforce those attributes.</p><p>So we recruited participants in the US, Brazil, Germany and India between the ages of 18 &nbsp;– 40 years, who represent our consumer target audience: people who make decisions about the companies they support based on their personal values and ideals, which are driven by bettering their communities and themselves. 157 people participated (average about 39 from each country), with a split between 49% men and 51% women. 69% were between 18 – 34 years, and 90% had some existing awareness of Mozilla.</p><p>For 2 days, they interacted with an online moderator and had the opportunity to see and respond to others’ opinions in real time.</p><p>Learnings from this qualitative research are not intended to provide statistical analysis on which identity system was “the winner.” &nbsp;Instead respondents talk about what they’re seeing, while the moderator uncovers trends within these comments, and dives deeper into areas that are either highly favorable or unfavorable by asking “why?” &nbsp;This type of research is particularly valuable at our stage of an identity design process – where we’ve identified the strategic idea, and are figuring out the best way to bring it to life. Consumers not intimately familiar with Mozilla view the brand identity system with fresh eyes, helping illuminate any blind spots and provide insights into what helps new audiences better understand us.</p><p><b>Tapping into internal experts</b></p><p>Another extremely important set of stakeholders who have provided insights throughout the entire project, and especially at this stage, is our brand advisory group, composed of technologists, designers, strategists and community representatives from throughout Mozilla. This team was responsible not only for representing their “functional” area, but also accountable for representing the community of Mozillians across the world. We met every two weeks, sharing work-in-progress and openly and honestly discussing the merits and misses of each design iteration.</p><p>In addition to regular working sessions, we also asked our brand advisory group members to represent the work with their own networks, field questions, and surface concerns. &nbsp;At one point, one of our technology representatives called out that several developers and engineers did not understand the strategic intent and approach to project, and needed a better framework by which to evaluate the work in progress. &nbsp;So we convened this group for a frank and freewheeling conversation, and everyone —the design team included — walked away with a much deeper appreciation for the opportunities and challenges.</p><p>That exchange inspired us to host a series of “brown bag” conversations, open to all staff and volunteer Mozillians. &nbsp;During one week in October, we hosted five 60-minute sessions, as early as 7am PT and as late as 8pm PT to accommodate global time zones and participants. We also videotaped one session and made that available on AirMozilla, our video network, for those unable to attend in person. Throughout those 5 days, over 150 people participated in those critique sessions, which proved to be rich with constructive ideas.</p><p>The important thing to note is that these “brown bag” sessions were not driving toward consensus, but instead invited critical examination and discussion of the work based on a very explicit set of criteria. Similar to the qualitative research conducted with our target consumer audience, these discussions allowed us to ask “why” and “why not” and truly understand emotional reactions in a way that quantitative surveys aren’t able to do.</p><p>The participation and contribution of our brand advisory group has been invaluable. They’ve been tough critics, wise counsel, patient sounding boards, trusted eyes and ears and ultimately, strategic partners in guiding the brand identity work. They’re helping us deliver a solution that has global appeal, is technically beautiful, breaks through the clutter and noise, scales across all of our products, technologies, programs, and communities, and is fit for the future. &nbsp;Most importantly, they have been an important barometer in designing a system that is both true to who we are and pushes us to where we want to go.</p><p><b>Closing in on a recommendation</b></p><p>The feedback from the qualitative consumer research indicates that the new brand identity reinforces the majority of the key attributes we want Mozilla to represent. Along with insights from our brand advisory group and leadership, this feedback helps direct our work as we move to a final recommendation and find the right balance between bold and welcoming. Our goal is to share an update at our All Hands meeting in early December, almost exactly six months from the date we first shared options for strategic narratives to kick off the work. Following that, we’ll post it here as well.</p>",

When will we be able to play with it? When can we update all the Wikipedia articles about Mozilla, local communities’ websites headers, etc? How will deploying it take place on Mozilla side?</p>",

The example of MDN in the new identity still uses the dino, which suggests that the new identity still doesn’t have a good replacement icon.<br> * The example on the office wall reminds me of IE6’s About box.<br> * The Fira font still looks good with the new identity on mozilla.org. It seems to pair well with Zilla. We should keep using Fira – perhaps for more product-focused application; whereas Zilla could be for more activism/organisation-focused uses.<br> * If you make an example in red that says “This technology could fall into the right hands”, you’ll probably win me over.<br> * It isn’t *not*-Mozilla.<br> * The coloured versions of the logo remind me of Inverse.com.<br> * I want to like it.<br> * I hope I eventually like it.</p>",

Created for us by Typotheque in the Netherlands, Zilla is free and open to all.</p><p>Typotheque was an historic partner to Mozilla. They were the first type-foundry to release Web-based fonts, and Mozilla’s Firefox web browser was an early adopter of Web fonts. We chose to partner with Peter Bilak from Typotheque because of their deep knowledge of localization of fonts, and our commitment to having a font that includes languages beyond English. Prior to partnering with Typotheque, we received concepts and guidance from Anton Koovit and FontSmith.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-546\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/01/johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2.jpg\" alt=\"johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2-300x217.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2-600x434.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/johnsonbanks_Mozilla_zilla_type_2-1000x723.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>Selected to evoke the Courier font used as the original default in coding, Zilla has a journalistic feel. It bucks the current convention of sans serif fonts. Anyone can create the Mozilla logo by typing and highlighting with the Zilla font, making the logo open and democratic. The black box surrounding the logo is a key building block of the design, and echoes the way we all select type in toolbars and programs.</p><p>Mozilla comes first in any application of the system, just as the protocol begins any internet journey. Copy lines, colors, and images all flow from that starting point, much like a web journey.</p><p><b>Our color palette</b></p><p>Our color palette, derived from the highlight colors used by Firefox and other web browsers, distinguishes our brand from its contemporaries. Color flows into our logo and changes according to the context in which the logo is used. As we develop our style guide, we’ll define color pairings, intensities, and guidelines.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-544\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_color-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p><b>Our language and language architecture</b></p><p>Copy lines to the right or below the logo hold core Mozilla messages.&nbsp; They also hold program, event, and team names — simplifying and unifying a multitude of different Mozilla activities.

Since imagery is an important reflection of the diversity and richness of the Internet, however, we’ve made it an important component of our system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In digital applications, ever-changing imagery represents the unlimited bounty of the online ecosystem.

Static applications of our identity system include multiple, layered images as if taken as a still frame within a moving digital experience.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-542\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_imagery-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>How might it work? We intend to invite artists, designers, and technologists to contribute to an imagery collective, and we’ll code curated GIFs, animations, and still images to flow into mozilla.org and and other digital experiences. Through this open design approach, we will engage new design contributors and communities, and make more imagery available to all under Creative Commons. We’re looking for input from creative communities to help shape and expand this idea.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-540\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2.jpg\" alt=\"Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/01/Mozilla-12jan-1500px_apps2-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We will roll out the new brand identity in phases, much as we have with concepts in this open design process, so please be patient with our progress.

Now we have both salty, dry popcorn and sweet, wet soda. A great complementary combination. It also has the advantage of being flexible in tone for multiple contexts by either changing the content/style of the non-text elements or by changing the amount/size of non-text elements relative to the protocol wordmark.</p> <p>Once the non-text elements have more constraints on how they are composed (e.g. always 3 to 5 elements, must overlap in certain ways, should follow one of 4-5 color strategies, etc.) the visual branding will be top-notch.</p>",

Could McDonald’s Arches be more effective if they also conveyed more than company identity? </p> <p>Imagine Mozilla’s example with McDonald’s Arches. In the immediate vicinity of the arches, for every product or core company value, appropriate design and imagery follows. When a commercial advertises French Fries we may see a container spilling out in beautiful slow motion – but in a corner rests a static logo, “Gold Arches” + “Tiny container of French Fries”. Would this better inform the public that McDonald’s sells French Fries?</p> <p>Or say, McDonald’s changes the color of arches for further product or idea identification. A pink arch is for breast cancer awareness, or is it to let us know McDonald’s sells strawberry milkshakes? Is the green arch with half a leaf telling me that salads are on sale or are they going green and reducing their carbon footprint?</p> <p>The most successful logos are simple and only convey company identity. Expanding on that and avoiding convolution is a challenge; before too long things can be confusing and redundant with little standardization. That seems to be what is bothering some dissenters.</p>",

You need to ensure it still evokes thoughts of a brand that is (in more ways than one) a dinosaur that has survived the early days of the modern internet, while projecting relevancy for the future.</p> <p>I have functional issues with “Moz://a” that others have expressed (the “://” makes it difficult the search/hashtag, etc).  But I cannot deny the simple brilliance of it.</p> <p>You did, however, lose me at the “our imagery” section. I hope that the collection of images displayed is placeholder, because it looks like the visual equivalent of buzzwords. You do know what buzzwords are right? Linguistic hokum that marketing uses to trick CEOs with more money than brains, because the CEOs don’t understand the nuts and bolts of their company, but by God they’ve heard of “the cloud”. They don’t know what it is, or when it’s appropriate, but it sounds impressive! Everyone outside of marketing and management **hates** buzzwords. Hell, marketing might not even like them, but they don’t have to pitch ideas to Joe Nobody.</p> <p>The collections of images and memes look like noise without meaning that pollutes the simple elegance of “Moz://a”.  And they can be problematic. Who owns the original pictures? Suddenly grumpy cat’s lawyer is knocking on your door. Maybe the meaning of the meme is hidden or changes, use a stereotypical cartoon frog wearing a beret for Moz://a France, and you’re unintentionally supporting the alt-right or nazi-isms. Trying to force new memes almost never works, and the meaning ends up inverted…</p> <p>Stick with basic iconography, like the rocket for emerging technologies. For National branches, use a simplified map coloured in with it’s flag (and *maybe* one additional national icon). If you use too many visual cues you’ve overcomplicated the message and risk shooting yourself in the foot.</p>",

Because of how dated the logo looks, the company is certainly not going to appeal to the general public, and people will probably deride Mozilla as some sort of nerdy c**p. In addition, the imagery in the rebranding is too reminiscent of the images used during AOL’s rebranding to Aol in the early 2010s, and when AOL rebranded, perception of the new logo was also quite negative, and worsened perception of the brand. So, in summary, the new Mozilla logo is already dated as a result of its surrounding imagery, and the company should seriously consider retooling the rebrand to remove the dated elements and incorporate a more timeless design, or scrap the logo altogether and start the design process from scratch, with a timeless design given priority over “artsy” designs. The design can still be simple, it just needs to be a more timeless design.</p>",

Mozilla is a software company at its core and software is keeping it sustainable. For a software company this design direction is a big miss. I literally can’t name one thing in whole direction that is done right.</p> <p>From the very start of process I had low expectations, but didn’t thought that we will get this catastrophe. Why I got low expectations? Simply, you choose johnson banks for a partner. They have done some really great work, and exactly this great work can’t recommend them to work for company like Mozilla. Their visions are suitable for completely different fields. Your process was completely philosophical and at no point practical. </p> <p>How you plan to incorporate slab serif font into Firefox or MDN or any other product where usability is primary? You don’t of course. Big hole you got there in consistency. </p> <p>Protocol :// is indeed clever but is it usable? Mozilla is already having problems with recognition. And as much you have tested its readability and factor of coolness on Mozillians and I guess designers you got it wrong. Biggest share of average folks won’t get it and more importantly will not be able to read it correctly.</p> <p>Imagery? I can share you my scrapbooks if you need some of these. Of course if you are opening art museum… Chaos without end, consistency not even on sight. Applicable? Yes, in mass production of random t-shirts.</p> <p>Vibrant colors? Yes if you want user to close the tab(with eyes in pain) before he clicks download button. Animate them? This is where ophthalmologists start making real money. </p> <p>Sean Martell’s work from few years ago was on good track. This… this misses big time.</p>",

Mozilla is a software company at its core and software is keeping it sustainable. For a software company this design direction is a big miss. I literally can’t name one thing in whole direction that is done right.</p> <p>From the very start of process I had low expectations, but didn’t thought that we will get this catastrophe. Why I got low expectations? Simply, you choose johnson banks for a partner. They have done some really great work, and exactly this great work can’t recommend them to work for company like Mozilla. Their visions are suitable for completely different fields. Your process was completely philosophical and at no point practical. </p> <p>How you plan to incorporate slab serif font into Firefox or MDN or any other product where usability is primary? You don’t of course. Big hole you got there in consistency. </p> <p>Protocol :// is indeed clever but is it usable? Mozilla is already having problems with recognition. And as much you have tested its readability and factor of coolness on Mozillians and I guess designers you got it wrong. Biggest share of average folks won’t get it and more importantly will not be able to read it correctly.</p> <p>Imagery? I can share you my scrapbooks if you need some of these. Of course if you are opening art museum… Chaos without end, consistency not even on sight. Applicable? Yes, in mass production of random t-shirts.</p> <p>Vibrant colors? Yes if you want user to close the tab(with eyes in pain) before he clicks download button. Animate them? This is where ophthalmologists start making real money. </p> <p>Sean Martell’s work from few years ago was on good track.

I went back to London and we gave them a good scrubbing to put on public show.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-582\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-1.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-1\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-1.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-1-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-1-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-1-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>It’s easy to see, in retrospect, certain clear design themes starting to emerge from these earliest concepts. Firstly, the idea of directly picking up on Mozilla’s name in ‘The-Eye’ (and in a less overt way in the ‘Flik-Flak’). ‘The-Eye’ also hinted at the dinosaur-slash-Godzilla iconography that had represented Mozilla at one time. We also see at this stage the earliest, and most minimal version of the ‘Protocol’ idea.</p><p>TM: You explored several routes related to code, and ‘Protocol’ was the cleverest. Mary Ellen and I were both drawn to ‘The-Eye’ for its suggestion that Mozilla would be opinionated and bold. It had a brutal power, but we were also a bit worried that it was too reminiscent of the-Eye of Sauron or Monsters, Inc.</p><p>MJ: Logos can be a bit of a Rorschach test, can’t they? Within a few weeks, we’d come to a mutual conclusion as to which of these ideas needed to be left on the wayside, for various reasons. The ‘Open-Button’, whilst enjoyed by many, seemed to restrict Mozilla too closely to just one area of work. Early presentation favourites such as ‘The Impossible M’ turned out to be just a little too close to other things out in the ether, as did Flik-Flak – the value, in a way, of sharing ideas publicly and doing an impromptu IP check with the world. ‘Wireframe World’ was to come back, in a different form in the second round.</p><p>TM: This phase was when our brand advisory group, a regular gathering of Mozillians representing different parts of our organization, really came into play. We had developed a list of criteria by which to review the designs – Global Reach, Technical Beauty, Breakthrough Design, Scalability, and Longevity – and the group ranked each of the options. It’s funny to look back on this now, but ‘Protocol’ in its original form received some of the lowest scores.</p><p>MJ: One of my sharpest memories of this round of designs, once they became public was how many online commentators critiqued the work for being ‘too trendy’ or said ‘this would work for a gallery not Mozilla’. This was clearly going to be an issue because, rightly or wrongly, it seemed to me that the tech and coding community had set the bar lower than we had expected in terms of design.</p><p>TM: A bit harsh there, Michael? It was the tech and coding community that had the most affinity for ‘Protocol’ in the beginning. If it wasn’t for them, we might have let it go early on.</p><p>MJ: Ok, that’s a fair point. Well, we also started to glimpse what was to become another recurring theme – despite johnson banks having been at the vanguard of broadening out brands into complete and wide-ranging identity systems, we were going to have to get used to a TL:DR way of seeing/reading that simply judged a route by its logo alone.</p><p>TM: Right! And no matter how many times we said that these were early explorations we received feedback that they were too “unpolished.” Meanwhile, others felt that they were too polished, suggesting that this was the final design. We were whipsawed by feedback.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-581\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-2.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-2.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-2-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-2-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-2-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>MJ: Whilst to some the second round seemed like a huge jump from the first, to us it was a logical development. All our attempts to develop The-Eye had floundered, in truth – but as we did that work, a new way to hint at the name and its heritage had appeared. It was initially nicknamed ‘Chomper’, but was then swiftly renamed ‘Dino-2.0’. We see, of course the second iteration of Protocol, this time with slab-serifs. And two new approaches – Flame and Burst.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-580\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-3.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-3\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-3.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-3-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-3-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-3-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TM: I kind of fell in love with ‘Burst’ and ‘Dino-2.0’ in this round. I loved the idea behind ‘Flame’ — that it represented both our eternal quest to keep the Internet alive and healthy and the warmth of community that’s so important to Mozilla — but not this particular execution. To be fair, we’d asked you to crank it out in a matter of days.</p><p>MJ: Well, yes that’s true. With ‘Flame’ we then suffered from too close a comparison to all the other flame logos out in there in the ether, including Tinder. Whoops! ‘Burst’ was, and still is, a very intriguing thought – that we see Mozilla’s work through 5 key nodes and questions, and see the ‘M’ shape that appears as the link between statistical points.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-579\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-4.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-4\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-4.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-4-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-4-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-4-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>TM: Web developers really rebelled against the moire of Burst, didn’t they? We now had four really distinct directions that we could put into testing and see how people outside of Mozilla (and North America) might feel. The testing targeted both existing and desired audiences, the latter being ‘Conscious Choosers’, a group of people who made decisions based on their personal values.</p><p>MJ: We also put these four in front of a design audience in Nashville at the Brand New conference, and of course commentary lit up the Open Design blog. The results in person and on the blogs were pretty conclusive – that Protocol and Dino-2.0 were the clear favourites. But one set of results were a curve ball – that the overall ‘feel’ of Burst was enjoyed by a key group of desired (and not current) supporters.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-578\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-5.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-5\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-5.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-5-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-5-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-5-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>TM: This was a tricky time. ‘Dino’ had many supporters, but just about as many vocal critics. As soon as one person remarked “It looks like a stapler,” the entire audience of blog readers piled on, or so it seemed. At our request, you put the icon through a series of operations that resulted in the loss of his lower jaw. Ouch. Even then, we had to ask, as beloved as this dino character was for its historical reference to the old Mozilla, would it mean anything to newcomers?</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-577\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-6.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-6\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-6.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-6-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-6-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-6-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>MJ: Yes, this was an odd period. For many, it seemed that the joyful and playful side of the idea was just too much ‘fun’ and didn’t chime with the desired gravitas of a famous Internet not-for-profit wanting to amplify its voice, be heard and be taken seriously. Looking back, Dino died a slow and painful death.</p><p>TM: Months later, rogue stickers are still turning up of the ‘Dino’ favicon showing just the open jaws without the Mozilla word mark. A sticker seemed to be the perfect vehicle for this design idea. And meanwhile, ‘Protocol’ kept chugging along like a tortoise at the back of the race, always there, never dropping out.</p><p>MJ: We entered the autumn period in a slightly odd place. Dino had been effectively trolled out of the game. Burst had, against the odds, researched well, but more for the way it looked than what it was trying to say. And Protocol, the idea that had sat in the background whilst all around it hogged the spotlight, was still there, waiting for its moment. It had always researched well, especially with the coding community, and was a nice reminder of Mozilla’s pioneering spirit with its nod to the http protocol.</p><p>TM: To me though, the ‘Protocol’ logo was a bit of a one-trick pony, an inside joke for the coding community that didn’t have as much to offer to the non-tech world. You and I came to the same conclusion at the same time, Michael. We needed to push ‘Protocol’ further, maybe even bring over some of the joy and color of routes such as ‘Burst’ and the fun that ‘Dino’ represented.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-576\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-7.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-7\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-7.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-7-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-7-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-7-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>MJ: Our early reboot work wasn’t encouraging. Simply putting the two routes together, such as this, looked exactly like what it is: two routes mashed together. A boardroom compromise to please no-one. But, gradually, some interesting work started to emerge, from different parts of the studio.</p><p>We began to think more about how Mozilla’s key messages could really flow from the Moz://a ‘start’, and started to explore how to use intentionally attention grabbing copy-lines next to the mark, without word spaces, as though written into a URL.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-575\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-8.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-8\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-8.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-8-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-8-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-8-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>We also experimented with the Mozilla wordmark used more like a ‘selected’ item in a design or editing programme – where that which is selected reverses out from that around it.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-574\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-9.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-9\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-9.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-9-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-9-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-9-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>From an image-led perspective, we also began to push the Mozilla mark much further, exploring if it could be shattered, deconstructed or glitched, in so becoming a much more expressive idea.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-573\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-10.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-10\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-10.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-10-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-10-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-10-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>In parallel, an image-led idea had developed, which placed the Mozilla name at the beginning of an imaginary toolbar, and there followed imagery culled directly from the Internet, in an almost haphazard way.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-572\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-11.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-11\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-11.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-11-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-11-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-11-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>TM: This slide, #19 in the exploratory deck, was the one that really caught our attention. Without losing the ‘moz://a’ idea that coders loved, it added imagery that suggested freedom and exploration which would appeal to a variety of audiences. It was eye-catching. And the thought that this imagery could be ever-changing made me excited by the possibilities for extending our brand as a representation of the wonder of the Internet.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-571\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-12.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-12\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-12.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-12-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-12-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-12-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MJ: When we sat back and took stock of this frenetic period of exploration, we realised that we could bring several of these ideas together, and this composite stage was shared with the wider team.</p><p>What you see from this, admittedly slightly crude ‘reboot’ of the idea, are the roots of the final route – a dynamic toolkit of words and images, deliberately using bright, neon, early-internet hex colours and crazy collaged imagery. This was really starting to feel like a viable way forward to us.</p><p>To be fair, we’d kept Mozilla slightly in the dark for several weeks by this stage. We had retreated to our design ‘bunker’, and weren’t going to come out until we had a reboot of the Protocol idea that we thought was worthy. That took a bit of explaining to the team at Mozilla towers.</p><p>TM: That’s a very comic-book image you have of our humble digs, Michael. But you’re right, our almost daily email threads went silent for a few weeks, and we tap-danced a bit back at the office when people asked when we’d see something. It was make or break time from all perspectives.

But, certain amends began almost immediately: we’d realised that stand-out of the logo was much improved if it reversed out of a block, and we started to explore softening the edges of the type-forms. And whilst the crazy image collages were, broadly, enjoyed, it was clear that we were going to need some clear rules on how these would be curated and used.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-567\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-16.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-16\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-16.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-16-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-16-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-16-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>TM: We had the most disagreement over the palette. We found the initial neon palette to be breathtaking and a fun recollection of the early days of the Internet. On the other hand, it didn’t seem practical for use in the user interface for our web properties, especially when these colors were paired together. And our executive team found the neons to be quite polarizing.</p><p>MJ: We were asked to explore a more ‘pastel’ palette, that to our eyes lacked some of the ‘oomph’ of the neons. We’d also started to debate the black bounding box, and whether it should or shouldn’t crop the type on the outer edges. We went back and forwards on these details for a while.</p><p>TM: To us, it helped to know that the softer colors picked up directly from the highlight bar in Firefox and other browsers. We liked how distinctive the cropped bounding box looked and grew used to it quickly, but ultimately felt that it created too much tension around the logo.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-566\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-17.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-17\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-17.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-17-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-17-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-17-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>MJ: And as we continued to refine the idea for launch, we also debated the precise typeforms of the logo. In the first stage of the Protocol ‘reboot’ we’d proposed a slab-serif free font called Arvo as the lead font, but as we used it more, we realised many key characters would have to be redrawn.</p><p>That started a new search – for a type foundry that could both develop a slab-serif font for Mozilla, and at the same time work on the final letterforms of the logo so there would be harmony between the two. We started discussions with Arvo’s creators, and also with Fontsmith in London, who had helped on some of the crafting of the interim logos and also had some viable typefaces.</p><p>TM: Meanwhile a new associate creative director, Yuliya Gorlovetsky, had joined our Mozilla team, and she had distinct ideas about typeface, wordmark, and logo based on her extensive typography experience.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-565\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-18.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-18\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-18.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-18-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-18-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-18-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>MJ: Finally, after some fairly robust discussions, Typotheque was chosen to do this work, and above and below you can see the journey that the final mark had been on, and the editing process down to the final logo, testing different ways to tackle the key characters, especially the&nbsp; ‘m’, ‘z’ and ‘a’.</p><p>This work, in turn, and after many debates about letterspacing, led to the final logo and its set of first applications.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-564\" src=\"http://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-19.jpg\" alt=\"blog-pics-13feb-19\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-19.jpg 1500w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-19-300x212.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-19-600x424.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/blog-pics-13feb-19-1000x707.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></p><p>TM: So here we are. Looking back at this makes it seem a <em>fait accompli</em> somehow, even though we faced setbacks and dead-ends along the way. You always got us over the roadblocks though, Michael, even when you disagreed profoundly with some of our decisions.</p><p>MJ: Ha! Well, our job was and is to make sure you stay true to your original intent with this brand, which was to be much bolder, more provocative and to reach new audiences. I’ll admit that I sometimes feared that corporate forces or the online hordes were wearing down the distinctive elements of any of the systems we were proposing.</p><p>But, even though the iterative process was occasionally tough, I think it’s worked out for the best and it’s gratifying that an idea that was there from the very first design presentation slowly but surely became the final route.</p><p>TM: It’s right for Mozilla.

Looks too much like an old-style typewriter, which I used too many years to find in the least bit attractive, but sometimes old becomes new again and the font will work over time, a favorite. </p> <p>I love that the protocol :// really fit the name mozilla to a T.  It is just genius; even while I’m not sure if, of itself, it can fill all the gaps you are wanting in a brand.  Time will tell.</p> <p>Also, not sure if it was intentional, or not, but I read the hand as making the sign of  “Ok”  as also making the symbol for “zero $$, or FREE” which definitely captures the spirit and intent of Mozilla to begin with. Another stroke of genius! If not, a stroke of my genius to see both things  ;)</p> <p>What I do not care for AT ALL is the color pallete: To begin with purplish-pink, orange and yellow are hideous colors to combine. I have no doubt that you will achieve what Denny’s Restaurant chain wanted when they chose this color scheme:  To get serviced-customers moving out of their restaurants quickly to make room for new customers.  These clashing colors, along with hard plastic seats, made people uncomfortable and made them all but run out of their restaurant after having eaten.  I don’t think this is Mozilla’s long term goal. I fancy a palette which is more soothing over hours of viewing, and definitely something more pleasing to the_eye. Something, perhaps, a bit more neutral without losing vibrancy in the processes.</p> <p>Of course, I am but one voice among many. I put in my two cents and look forward to what comes in hopes that it will be a process that continues to evolve and move forward until creators and contributors eventually arrive at the perfect combination of colors and symbols.</p>",

Perhaps Typotheque could come up with characters that would be “different enough” from the new font, to make it seem less like character code and a bit more differentiated.

I’m merely a hack.<br> But if you offset the :// in such a way, using an altogether different font<br> and setting it apart, maybe in a gradient color, the Logo would look<br> more pulled together and more cohesive.<br> I do believe the use of a separate font would, and in a smaller size than the rest of the name, would make the :ll less prominent.

It could also be turned into a slab, and be used for the identity if it makes sense. It has a very nice look, it looks professional, not as corporate professional but it doesn’t look like a font we find for free on the Internet :) (Yes I know many free fonts look better now, you got the point.)<br> I think this logo, even if it has a great potential, doesn’t look very professional, meaning it looks cheap, not refined enough. Even if you want a “punky” look, it doesn’t have to look amateur. I’m sorry for using this confrontation of pro/amateur concepts but I think open source community usually lacks this kind of genius in design you find in modern brands and it shouldn’t be that way. Anyway, i just made a quick image with the Fira font and this concept and I think it would look better, but hey, open process, let’s talk about it. &lt;3 Mozilla</p> <div class=\"comment-image-box\"> <p class=\"comment-image-reloaded\"><a class=\"cir-image-link image-id-588\" href=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/mozilla.png\"><img width=\"600\" height=\"190\" src=\"https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/opendesign/files/2017/02/mozilla-600x190.png\" class=\"attachment-baseline-mini-grid-thumb size-baseline-mini-grid-thumb\" alt=\"mozilla\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/mozilla-600x190.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/files/2017/02/mozilla-300x94.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 600px, (max-width: 1000px) 160px, 300px\"></a></p> </div>",

      "content": "<p>I love what Mozilla has been doing but based on some of the comments I have read here it appears to me that there are a lot of people who do not understand the Mozilla role.  I have been using the products from the Mosaic/Netscape days.  I have assumed the name came from the combination of Mosaic and Godzilla and that the Godzilla influence had to do with the little original gecko mascot thingy (maybe making him seem tougher?) Anyways I believe you need to provide some historical context so the world will actually have a better understanding of your role. I find it difficult and I have had some background using several of the products you have developed over the years. Differentiating things like Mosaic, Netscape Navigator, Gecko, Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey are difficult for the common user. Your quest to rebrand may be a good one but it really doesn’t matter if the public does not understand what you do in the first place. To me Mozilla is the strong underlying foundation that has developed and supports other products.  As such the image needs to be strong, functional and stable. To me associating multiple images to the name does not meet that goal. In fact, it weakens an identity that is already not well understood.<br> I rely on Firefox as my browser and Thunderbird as my email client.  As far as Mozilla is concerned I want to know that the foundation will continue to support and improve these flagship products.  The name and image need to inspire confidence in the strength of this supporting foundation.  Visually I liked the impression of the Moz://a idea but I agree that this representation of the name comes with some major drawbacks. I don’t know how you will be able to overcome these problems outside your own products.  Maybe the Moz://a portion should only be provided as a graphic with an overlay (below?) with the real text.  Again, this will become a problem as the history of the name is forgotten.  Without knowing Mozilla who will recognize where Moz://a actually came from?</p>",

The rest is just junk that Illustrator adds to every SVG they make.

It is interesting that you have had to explain that none of this affects the Fox logo, that it won’t go away, and that Firefox is only pasrt of Mozilla. That shows the need to make the difference clear.  I really like the new font and logo. Some critics/ comments have good points, though some of it is over my head. I don’t know code, or the history of internet design as used in the 90’s… I think that will not be a big issue for most people, especially the general public. I assume you are mainly reaching out to the general public, and are seeking to inform and gain support from them.  Though I have no formal training in it, I think I have a decent eye for design.  I like your design changes, though I am concerned some of it is too “busy”. I’m sure you’ll make some adjustments as needed.

I’ve been using firefox since… 2010ish? and while it took a while to differentiate mozilla and the browser, I was intrigued with the nonprofit and always thought it’d be something I’d like to donate to when I was older. </p> <p>I think there is most certainly a place for mozilla among the googles and apples and microsofts, and this re-branding will hopefully confirm that. Your game is the internet. The intangible that leads to the tangible; while competitors are creating as many new and next-big-things as possible, you guys can fill the niche of a company pushing the boundaries of the abstract and dig deeper into the box that others now skim the top off to take elsewhere (apps, AI, VR, cars etc etc). Because who else is focusing solely on the ‘box’ itself? Everyone wants to think outside the box. </p> <p>The more that is known and done with the box, the more that can utilized by people to create real things wherever they are at – they won’t need to think right outside the box, they’ll come back to this highly useful box as needed and then create their own shapes to help with employment, agriculture, the environment, social justice, education, and so much more. I hope with this re-brand mozilla can become more visible and appreciated for the role it serves (if I am interpreting correctly). Looking forward to keeping up on where this goes!</p>",

You state “Color flows into our logo and changes according to the context in which the logo is used. As we develop our style guide, we’ll define color pairings, intensities, and guidelines.” Good idea, I can get behind that. However, does that mean that everything pink will have lace &amp; kittens and everything blue will have a sporty little baby boy as shown in logos on that page? You worry about being anachronistic, I’d suggest taking the “pink is for girls, blue is for boys” idea under consideration, and applying it sparingly &amp; only when it fits the context in a more modern way. I know, I know, some girls really like pink, some boys dig blue, just something to keep in mind.</p>",

I see more diversity with this was as a popout logo / shortened logo / or miniscule logo.
